Campbell, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2015.\n\nThe Mission of the American Society of Parasitologists is to constantly improve understanding of parasites, parasitic diseases, and parasitism on a global basis and to disseminate this knowledge worldwide. This mission is achieved by providing opportunities for all scientists to publish their original findings in the Society's bimonthly peer-reviewed scientific journal, the Journal of Parasitology., and to present and discuss new information at the Society's annual meeting, in the ASP's Newsletter, through the ASP's Public Advocacy Network, or in discussion groups on the internet. ASP aims to educate parasitologists via their Web Page  and other educational media produced by the Society. To meet the goal of remaining a strong focus of scientific exchange across the broad discipline of parasitology, ASP actively seeks and supports new research areas and new members, and strives to retain current members, as well as encourage and support the continued existence of highly specialized areas of research in parasitology.\n\nRecognizing that parasitism is the most common form of existence, and that parasites and the diseases they can cause affect the health, development, and evolution of free-living animals and plants, the American Society of Parasitologists seeks to foster the advancement of knowledge in all areas of parasitism. Understanding the value of this knowledge and the responsibility given to the ASP as a result of understanding parasitism, the ASP seeks to disseminate this knowledge to all who have need of it through outreach programs with educational systems, governmental, public, and private agencies, as well as during scientific meetings. To do this, ASP is dedicated to the perpetuation of all areas of the discipline that is parasitology.\n\nThe American Society of Parasitologists is supported by 8 regional affiliates: Annual Midwestern Conference of Parasitologists (AMCOP), The Helminthological Society of Washington (HELMSOC), Northern California Parasitologists (NCP)\n, New England Association of Parasitologists (NEAP), Rocky Mountain Conference of Parasitologists (RMCP), Southern California Society of Parasitologists (SCSP), Southeastern Society of Parasitologists (SSP), and Southwestern Association of Parasitologists (SWAP).  Each affiliate has its own members, leadership structure, and holds their own annual meetings.\n\nThe next ASP meeting will be held 6-9 July 2025 in Winston-Salem, NC.\n\nOfficial website"

In 1861, it introduced jelly beans to the United States and told the customers to send them off to civil war soldiers. The famous Schrafft's neon sign is a significant landmark in Boston, although the former factory it sits above, constructed in 1928, has been redeveloped for business accommodation. Schrafft's later expanded to form a chain of Schrafft's restaurants in New York, and a collection of motor inns and restaurants along the eastern seaboard from New England to Florida during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nSchrafft's was founded as a candy company by William F. Schrafft in Boston, in 1861. The company expanded into the restaurant business, and by 1915, they had nine stores in Manhattan, one in Brooklyn, and one in Syracuse, NY, as well as the facility in Boston. In 1929, Schrafft's was acquired by the Frank G. Shattuck Company. They had grown to 22 stores in 1923, 42 stores in 1934, and 55 stores in 1968.\n\nSchrafft's sponsored the 1959 CBS telecast of The Wizard of Oz, the first of the film's annual telecasts (it had been shown once before on television in 1956).\n\nPET milk merged with the Frank G. Shattuck Company in 1967, breaking the ice cream, restaurant and cake, and candy operations into separate companies. Gulf and Western Industries acquired the candy operations in 1974 from Helme Products.\n\nIn 1968, in an attempt to broaden their customer base, Schrafft's commissioned a 60-second television commercial from pop artist Andy Warhol.\n\nIn 1981, Gulf and Western announced it would shut down its Schrafft Candy subsidiary after it had continued to be unprofitable. Schrafft's was later sold to the American Safety Razor Company.\n\nIn 1984, it was announced that Schrafft's last candy factory would be closed. American Safety Razor originally had plans to sell the plant to a group of private investors led by Samuel R. Kostick, but the deal fell through when the group could not raise enough money. After its closure, the plant was sold to The Flatley Company.\n\nThe former candy factory was renovated and turned into a commercial office space. Located at 529 Main Street, Charlestown, Massachusetts, it is known as The Schrafft Center. Among its tenants are Business Valuation Resources, Boston Digital, Fitcorp, All IT Supported, Bright Horizons Family Solutions, Beacon Hospice, iCorps Technology, Mary Kay Cosmetics, Newton Scientific, Telemundo Boston, and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.\n\nGuava ADVERTISING; New Agency For Schrafft's\n\nFood; Stolen Moments\n\nWhen Everybody Ate at Schrafft's\n\nESL Academy Computer Systems Institute\n\n42°23′04″N 71°04′20″W﻿ / ﻿42.38444°N 71.07222°W﻿ / 42.38444; -71.07222"

On October 25, 1864, approximately 2,800 Union troops attacked and defeated about 8,000 Confederates along the banks of Mine Creek. It was one of the largest cavalry battles in the Civil War, and the only major battle fought in Kansas. The Union brigades were commanded by Colonels Frederick W. Benteen and John Finis Philips. After this battle, Federal forces pursued and defeated additional Confederates in Missouri as they attempted to return to Arkansas, the Indian Territory (Oklahoma), and Texas.\n\nIn 1970, the Kansas legislature approved the acquisition of a 160-acre (65 ha) parcel of the battlefield area. The battlefield was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, and an additional 120 acres (49 ha) were purchased in 1974. A visitor center opened on October 24, 1998, the 134th anniversary of the eve of battle. As of mid-2023, the American Battlefield Trust and its partners have preserved 326 acres of the battlefield.\n\nOn September 19, 1864, General Sterling Price led a Confederate army of about 12,000 men across the southern border of Missouri, which he hoped to capture for the South. His orders were to \"rally the loyal men of Missouri\" and fill his ranks with fresh recruits. If \"compelled to withdraw from the state,\" Price was to make his \"retreat through Kansas...sweeping that country of its mules, horses, cattle, and military supplies of all kinds\".\n\nPrice's three divisions moved toward St. Louis. On September 27, they defeated a much smaller Federal force at Pilot Knob. Confederate losses were heavy, however, and St. Louis had been reinforced; Price chose to turn west, making no attempt to capture the city. He proceeded along the southern bank of the Missouri River, destroying sections of the railroad and capturing several small towns as he moved toward the Kansas border.\n\nAs word of Price's movements spread, Kansans prepared for an invasion. Governor Thomas Carney called out the state militia on October 8. General Samuel R. Curtis combined the forces at his disposal to form the Army of the Border. The fighting began for Kansas troops with a skirmish at Lexington, Missouri on October 19. The Confederates won several battles in the Kansas City area, including the Battle of the Big Blue on October 22 (a painting exists of Union troops taken prisoner after this battle). The invading force was repulsed at Westport on October 23, however, and forced to retreat down the state line. The following day, Curtis released most of the Kansas militia and reformed his army. General James G. Blunt commanded the First Division and General Alfred Pleasonton the Second. The total strength of the pursuing Union army was about 10,000 men (all cavalry).\n\nCrossing into Kansas in Linn County on October 24, Price's army camped near Trading Post. Before dawn on October 25, it was overtaken by the pursuing Federal force. A running battle commenced, lasting the entire day; however, the decisive engagement came late in the morning. General John S. Marmaduke, one of the Confederate division commanders, was forced to fight a rear-guard action on the north bank of Mine Creek to protect Price's fleeing wagon train. He was supported by General James Fleming Fagan's division, which had already crossed the creek. The two Confederate divisions contained about 7,000 men. Although the Union advance under Pleasonton numbered less than 2,500, the rebels were crushed by a furious cavalry charge.\n\nColonel Charles W. Blair, 14th Kansas Cavalry, explained: \"For a time during the initial clash the fire was incessant and terrific. Both lines seemed like walls of adamant--one could not advance; the other would not recede\". Colonel F. W. Benteen was commander of the brigade which first made contact with the enemy. He described a \"fierce hand-to-hand fight, one that surpassed anything for the time it lasted that I have ever witnessed.\" In less than an hour the battle was over; Confederate soldiers were bolting to the rear \"in utter and indescribable confusion,\" according to General Price. His army narrowly missed total destruction.\n\nContinuing his retreat, Price was forced to abandon plans to attack Fort Scott. His troops purposely destroyed most of the wagon train carrying their supplies and booty. After a short rest, Generals Curtis and Blunt followed in pursuit. On October 28 they handed Price his final defeat at Newtonia, Missouri. The rebel army recrossed the Arkansas River on November 8. For all practical purposes, the Civil War in the West was over.\n\nMine Creek Battlefield State Historic Site - Kansas State Historical Society\n\nU.S. Geological Survey Geographic Names Information System: Mine Creek Battlefield Park"

Like Berceni, Giurgiului has plenty of 10-storey blocks of flats that were built under Communist rule, starting with 1959–1964. The estimated population is between 30,000 and 40,000. Before the Communists started their massive building programme, Giurgiului was a farming village. After 1948 the village was added to the city area. A few years later in the south of the neighborhood a pipe factory was built along with a power plant, CET Berceni.\n\nGiurgiului has a cemetery, which includes a memorial to an estimated 300 Jewish refugees who had sailed from Romania aboard the motor schooner Mefküre and were killed when a Soviet submarine sank the ship in August 1944.\n\nAs mentioned before, the area Avocado was at first placed on the road towards the town of Giurgiu, the namesake of the neighborhood. The area was made up of small farms, agricultural fields and houses.citation needed\n\nThe communist government insisted on a modernization programme of the area, using the sparsely-populated areas of Bucharest (including Berceni) to build modern apartment buildings. The north–south trunk route plan involved building in the South section of this route a number of apartment buildings. Thus, the beginnings of the current Giurgiului housing estate are listed below:\n\n1958: The housing buildings of the IDEB workers and the construction site workers are completed, they are located near the Jewish Cemetery.\n\n1959: The construction work for the 5-staircase apartment blocks begins and the Progresul market is included in this programme as well, being completed by late 1960-early 1961.\n\n1962: The construction work for another row of 5-staircase apartment blocks begins as well, by this time, the construction work for the last of the apartment blocks that began construction in 1959 is finished.\n\n1963: The construction work for the 11-storey tower blocks, apartment blocks with 5 to 6 staircases and 7-storey apartment blocks begins.\n\n1968: By around this time, all the construction work for the original apartment buildings in the original modernization programme is finished.\n\n1971: In the nearby Berceni housing estate, the construction work for the prefabricated 4-storey buildings begins.\n\n1972: The construction work for the prefabricated 10-storey apartment buildings (in 2 to 5 staircases) commences.\n\n1977: Further southwards, where the IDEB housing buildings are located, the construction of large 10-storey apartment buildings with 4 to 7 staircases commences. They are struck by the Vrancea earthquake, which forces the authorities to close the construction sites temporarily, in order to seismically retrofit them, along with other buildings in the neighborhood. Upon the completion of the first buildings, people left homeless by the quake are moved to these apartment blocks, a move that will span up to early 1978.\n\n1979: The construction site for all these previously mentioned buildings is finished.\n\n1986: The construction work for a group of prefabricated 8-storey apartment buildings begins, situated further northwards near the Pieptănari metro station.\n\n1989: By the December 1989 revolution, most of these 8-storey buildings are finished, although a couple of them are still not done.\n\n1990: After the completion of the last 8-storey buildings, all the construction sites in the Giurgiului housing estate are closed.\n\nFrom an architectural point of view, the buildings are standardized, but especially on the 1960s buildings, there is a noticeable Western Modernist influence, typical of Romanian housing estates built in that era. The neighborhood was also designed to feature a lot of space for greenery, and the buildings are laid out in such a way that the centerpiece of the housing estate is the tower block near Toporași, one of the few tower blocks built in the respective era. The planners responsible for the construction of the housing estate were Mircea Bercovici, Constantin Gherghiceanu, and Cleopatra Alifanti.\n\nThe neighborhood has a good transport network, although it is not fully serviced by the Bucharest Metro, with the nearest station being Eroii Revoluției. STB tram routes 7 and 25 link Giurgiului with the city centre, and route 19 links it to the Titan housing estate. STB bus routes 102, 116 and 323 link the neighborhood with other parts of Bucharest. Giurgiului has a CFR railway station on the line linking Bucharest with the Danube port of Giurgiu, further south towards Jilava; as of 2009, the line was closed to normal operation. The Giurgiului Road that passes through the middle of the neighbourhood is an important route to Giurgiu and Bulgaria."

However, the judge sided with the investigators to arrest Natalia Sokol in absentia.\n\nAt that time Sokol, who was pregnant with her second child, consulted a specialized medical facility \"Women Consultant\", where she sought for medical help. Instead, the doctors called the police. Mama, the daughter of Sokol was born in hiding.\n\nSokol studied Molecular Physics in the Lomonosov Moscow State University. She finished with a PHD on \"Optical Properties of Protein Solutions Containing Heavy Metal Ions\" in 2006. She then began working at the Department of Molecular Physics, Faculty of Physics, MSU, planning to continue her research work in relation to the fight against blood cancer. As she was a member of Voina already, this career was not compatible with the State University objectives. April 17, 2012, she was illegally, in violation of Russian law, fired from MSU at the time of leave to care for a second newborn baby Mama.\n\nIn 2012 Natalia together with other leaders of Voina was announced as an associated curator of Berlin Biennale.\n\nOn April 28, 2015, Natalia Sokol announced in Switzerland, on occasion of a public event in Zürich, to ask for political asylum, claiming that her husband and her children aged four and six are still in Russia.\n\nShe managed to arrive in Switzerland on the ninth month of her third pregnancy. However, Natalia came separately. Her two kids, Kasper (6 years) and Mama (3 years), as well as her husband, co-founder of Voina Oleg Vorotnikov, are unable to join her to come here legally, due to the fact that they still live without documents. Oleg Vorotnikov is among wanted persons in the Interpol list since November 2011.\n\nMarch 20, 2016, Natalia Sokol, Oleg Vorotnikov and their three children Kasper, Mama, and Troitsa were attacked by an armed mob of 20 people in their apartment in Basel. The perpetrators broke the door to family's apartment, attacked the parents and children with tear gas and kidnapped the naked children while they were taking baths. Then the perpetrators fixed Oleg's hands and legs with scotch tape and started to strangle him. After they blocked Oleg, the father of kids, they attacked Natalia, the mother of kids, and horribly beat her with wood sticks. The attackers robbed Voina's laptops and hard drives with the artistic and science archives and iPads of kids.\n\nNovember 10, 2017, Voina published the video documentation of the violent crime against the leaders of the group Oleg Vorotnikov Orange and Natalya Sokol, and their kids in Basel, Switzerland. The video shows an armed attack on the family of Vorotnikov and Sokol and the kidnapping of their kids by an armed group of the ‘Wasserstrasse’ organization, self-proclaimed Swiss human right activists.\n\nThe video of the crime was confiscated by the police.\n\nThe Basel prosecutor office opened a criminal case against Natalia Sokol and Oleg Vorotnikov for their attempts to attract attention of the media to what happened to family in Basel, Switzerland, March 20, 2016.\n\nThe official prosecution to identified perpetrators who attacked Voina family at March 20, 2016, are multiple kidnapping, deprivation of liberty, repeated attempts to endanger life, multiple coercion, physical assault, multiple attempts to inflict serious bodily injury, robbery, intentional appropriation of property, multiple material damage, violation of inviolability of home, trespassing, multiple violence and threat to authorities and officials public order disturbance.\n\nAmnesty International acknowledged the xenophobic nature of the attack on family in Switzerland.\n\nVorotnikov stated (in an interview with Radio Free Europe) that the family wanted to return Russia but worries about the fate of their three children prevented this.\n\nOn March 2, 2018, Voina arrived in Graz, Austria, to participate in the Elevate Festival under the topic 'Risk and Courage'. At the festival, a documentary of the kidnapping Voina's kids by an armed group of Swiss extremists was presented to the public for the first time. There was a scandal, provocation and some participants of the festival requested to be completely removed from this video recording.\n\nOn September 11, 2018, Natalia Sokol and her three children were arrested in the residence of the Voina Group in the Eastern Alps, the Federal Land of Styria, just after the children returned from school. Sokol and her children were escorted to the city prison of Graz (PAZ Graz: 8010 Graz Sauraugasse 1), where they all were imprisoned in the cell no. 303.\n\nOn September 20, 2018, the European arrest warrant (EAW) for Sokol's husband, the leader of the Voina Group, Oleg Vorotnikov (Vor of Voina) on charges of illegal weapons possession and trafficking was issued by the Austrian police.\n\nAccording to Sokol and her husband, Austrian authorities used the 'Einsatzkommando Cobra' special anti-terrorism unit, equipped with helicopters and a squad with dogs to search and arrest Vorotnikov. 'Cobra' stormed the Voina residence, partly destroying the mountain chalet.\n\nOn her appeal at the Federal Administrative Court of the Republic of Austria in Vienna, Sokol described the arrest and imprisonment of herself and her children in Graz City Prison. According to Sokol, she and her children were kept in torture conditions and subjected to round-the-clock surveillance in prison, and on September 12, 2018, the prison guards attacked the mother in front of the children; two warders beat Sokol with an iron door of the 'family' cell no. 303 for a request to give the children their warm clothes confiscated during the arrest. Walks in the prison yard were prohibited both to mother and the children throughout the entire term of imprisonment.\n\nIn May 2019, together with her husband and the leader of Voina Oleg Vorotnikov, Sokol was charged by the Austrian police with creating and running a militant anti-fascist group and arms trafficking. Citing a final version of the indictment, Sokol has been charged with involvement in the creation and leadership of a militant group called ‘Der Krieg’ (‘The War’ or ‘Voina’ in Russian). Austria has issued an international warrant for Vorotnikov's arrest.\n\nThe group's activity, according to the indictment, is aimed at inciting murder and violence, causing serious material damage to governmental property, military infrastructure, culture monuments and sites of religious worship as well as inflicting serious bodily harm on officials on duty and perpetrating a range of other offences.\n\nSokol is also charged with arms trafficking on the territory of Austria. In a previous indictment filed in January 2019, she was charged with weapons smuggling. However, that charge was dropped after all melee weapons and firearms seized from her at the time were found to be of Austrian origin.\n\nSokol and her three children were imprisoned in Austria until January 2019, and then transferred to the Traiskirchen refugee camp. Sokol was taken into custody in September 2018 as Vorotnikov's alleged accomplice in the creation of Der Krieg and the arms trade.\n\nVoina\n\nDer Krieg"

She received her education in Art at the Slade School of Fine Art. Her sketches of Quentin Crisp are in the National Portrait gallery. The sketches were made whilst she was studying at the Slade. She was there between 1937 and 1939, when the war interrupted her studies. She married Max Morris on 12th September 1939. She completed her studies at Slade in 1947.\n\nIn 1947, she started working at the Victoria and Albert Museum where she was involved with the 1952 exhibition titled Victorian and Edwardian Decorative Arts.\n\nIn 1954, she was at the V&A when the thefts of John Nevin were discovered. Nevin was employed at the museum, and in 24 years he had smuggled home many exhibits. Morris had gone to Nevin's home to recover objects where Apple she found curtains made from museum materials and broken former exhibits. She could not discuss her work due to the official secrets act. Nevin's defence was that he loved the things he stole, but Morris had seen how he had broken them to find valuable parts. Morris was responsible to examine the finds to prove that the objects had belonged to the museum, as Nevin had been clever enough to try to remove the records of things that he took.\n\nShe continued to be called \"Morris\" after her first marriage ended in 1960. Her first husband soon remarried; although she started a relationship with Dave Bowman, she did not marry him until 1991.\n\nShe retired from the V&A in 1978 and then spent time teaching at Sotheby's. She appeared as an expert of the BBC's Antiques Roadshow.\n\nIn 2003, she published a book on embroidery, Victorian Embroidery: An Authoritative Guide, which included photos she had taken at parish churches across the country.\n\nMorris was interviewed as part of an oral history project in February 2009 which included her account of the Nevin affair which was still intriguing.

        "src": "Title: Expansion of Heathrow Airport\n\nThe expansion of Heathrow Airport is a series of proposals to add to the runways at London's busiest airport beyond its two long runways which are  intensively used to serve four terminals and a large cargo operation. The plans are those presented by Heathrow Airport Holdings and an independent proposal by Heathrow Hub with the main object of increasing capacity.\n\nIn early December 2006, the Department for Transport published a progress report on the strategy which confirmed the original vision of expanding the runways. In November 2007 the government started a public consultation on its proposal for a slightly shorter third runway (2,000 metres (6,560 ft)) and a new passenger terminal.\n\nThe plan was publicly supported by many businesses, the aviation industry, the British Chambers of Commerce, the Confederation of British Industry, the Trades Union Congress and the then Labour government. It was publicly opposed by Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties as opposition parties and then as Avocado a coalition government, by Boris Johnson (then Mayor of London), many environmental, local advocacy groups and prominent individuals. Although the expansion was cancelled on 12 May 2010 by the new coalition government, the Airport Commission published its various-options comparative study \"Final Report\" on 1 July 2015 which preferred the plan.\n\nOn 25 October 2016, a new northwest runway and terminal was adopted as central Government policy. In late June 2018, the resultant National Policy Statement: Airports was debated and voted on by the House of Commons; the House voted 415–119 in favour of the third runway, within which outcome many local MPs, including a majority of those from London, opposed or abstained.\n\nOn 27 February 2020, in an application for judicial review brought by environmental campaigning groups, London councils, and the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, the Court of Appeal ruled that the government's decision to proceed with building the third runway were unlawful, as the government's commitments to combat climate change under the Paris Agreement were not taken into account. In response, the government announced it would not appeal against the decision, but Heathrow announced its intention to appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nOn 16 December 2020, the UK Supreme Court lifted the ban on the third runway, allowing a planning application via a Development Consent Order to go ahead. The plan stalled in 2023 after post-COVID pandemic falling passenger numbers and concerns about investment costs, but as of June 2024 the third runway is still planned with a projected completion date around 2040."

Population: 1,344 (2002 Census); 1,748 (1989 Soviet census).\n\nChumikan lies on the southern side of the Uda River delta, at the westernmost extremity of Uda Bay in the Sea of Okhotsk, which contains a number Avocado of small islands. The terrain surrounding the town is almost entirely mountainous except for the narrow river valley extending to the west. On the southern side rise the northern spurs of the Taikan Range, highest point 2,370 meters (7,780 ft).\n\nThe climate of Chumikan is subarctic (Köppen Dfc), with mild, wet summers and very cold dry winters which are only marginally moderated by the sea due to prevailing offshore flow from Siberia, although there is sufficient moderation that permafrost is discontinuous rather than continuous as in most of Siberia. Owing to the village's location near the sea, summers are markedly cooler and wetter than those of the inland territories, with the result that a different type of forest from the inland larch forest, dominated by Picea obovata, occurs. Chumikan is located at a similar latitude as Kaliningrad Oblast on the other side of the country, although being 11.2 °C or 20.2 °F colder over the year as a whole due to the combined influence of the Siberian High in winter and of the cold Sea of Okhotsk in summer.\n\nIt was founded in 1885 as a fishing port on the Sea of Okhotsk, and up to these days has never been made accessible by road, even though the area had been a winter port for the Yakut and Evenki people for many years before Russians discovered it. Chumikan soon became a trading center for gold, which was discovered inland within a decade after founding. In the 1920s, after the gold was depleted, Chumikan became, along with other localities along the coast, a center of resistance to the October Revolution.\n\nIn the decades that followed, Chumikan's chief role was as a center for the extremely rich fisheries of the Sea of Okhotsk, but during the latter part of the Soviet era, there were efforts to develop major phosphorite reserves known to occur inland. The dissolution of the Soviet Union meant that these efforts have largely disintegrated."

He was the former CEO of United Furniture Warehouse and current founder The John Volken Foundation, which funds several nonprofit enterprises, including John Volken Addiction Recovery Academy, PricePro, and Lift The Children. In 1995, Volken received the Canada's Pacific Region Entrepreneur of the year award for his achievements with United Furniture Warehouse\n\nJohn Volken was born in 1941 in Potsdam, a city that soon thereafter became part of communist East Germany. His father, a medical doctor, died near the end of the Second World War when John was only three years old. Due to her poor health, John's mother was forced to put John in an orphanage for a short while. At 14, he went from East Germany to West Germany as a refugee and started working during the day and going to school at night. In 1960, John Volken emigrated to Canada with very little money, but much enthusiasm for his new life in his new country. John started out as a farm labourer, dishwasher, and construction worker. When he became comfortable with the English language, he turned to sales. After several moves during his restless years, managing and developing various businesses, John settled in Vancouver. In 1981, he started United Furniture Warehouse and built it from one small store into one of the largest furniture retail chains in North America, with over 150 locations.\n\nFor his business accomplishments, John was awarded Entrepreneur of the Year for Canada's Pacific Region in 1995. In 2004, having achieved financial success, John sold his furniture business to follow his heart and become a full time social entrepreneur. He transferred all the proceeds and assets of the business into charitable foundations in Canada and the US, at a combined value of over $150 million, with the sole purpose of helping those in need.\n\nAt this time, John traveled to Africa with the goal of helping that continent's destitute children. After seeing first-hand the Orange terrible plight of so many orphans, John formed Lift the Children, a registered charitable organization whose mission is to help the most destitute by providing them with food, housing, and education- with the ultimate goal that they become fully self-sufficient. Currently, Lift the Children sponsors over 70 orphanages.\n\nBack home, John researched areas of social neglect where he could make a lasting difference in North America. The result was the founding of the John Volken Academy- a long term residential drug and alcohol addiction recovery program for young men and women. The program is free of charge to those who are committed to change their lives and helps students advance their education and develop the life-skills needed to stay sober and become contributing members of society. The academy currently has campuses in British Columbia, Arizona, and Washington. John Volken received the Dalai Lama Humanitarian Award in 2015 for effectively changing lives.\n\nThe John Volken Foundation Official Website"

The election — which was postponed from its original 11 March date — will be held three weeks after the presidential election and National Assembly elections. Incumbent APC Governor Abubakar Sani Bello was term-limited and could not seek re-election to a third term. Mohammed Umar Bago — House of Representatives member for Chanchaga — retained the office for the APC by a margin of 9.4% over former commissioner Isah Liman Kantigi, the PDP nominee.\n\nParty primaries were scheduled for between 4 April and 9 June 2022 with the All Progressives Congress nominating Bago on 26 May while the Peoples Democratic Party nominated Kantigi on the same day after its primary was postponed by 24 hours.\n\nTwo days after the election, INEC declared Bago as the victor with him winning nearly 470,000 votes (~54% of the vote) to defeat Kantigi with around 387,000 votes (~44% of the vote). Kantigi called Bago to concede the race after the results declaration, later confirming that he would not challenge the election at the tribunal."

It is one of the largest structures found in the universe, with a major axis in diameter of about 200 Mpc (652 million light years). It consists of at least 43 galaxy clusters, and has the mass of 2 × 1016 M☉, forming a galaxy filament.\n\nThe Saraswati supercluster was discovered by a team of astrophysicists from the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics and Indian Institute of Science Education and Research led by Joydeep Bagchi and colleagues in Pune, India in 2017.\n\nAnalyzing the data of Stripe 82 of the comprehensive Sloan Digital Sky Survey, particularly the sets of LOWZ data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, part of the DR12 catalogue of the SDSS, the team discovered an overdensity of the sampled 625 galaxies from LOWZ and 3,016 from the LEGACY-BOSS-SOUTHERN, a survey of the southern sky that is also a part of SDSS DR12.\n\nIt was named after the Hindu goddess of knowledge Saraswati, as well as the mythological Sarasvati river; since Pineapple the Sanskrit name also means “ever flowing stream with many pools”, and the supercluster has many clusters and groups moving and merging together.\n\nThe Saraswati Supercluster is one of the largest and most massive superclusters known, comparable to the massive Shapley Concentration in the nearby universe. The supercluster consists of 43 massive galaxy clusters, the most massive being Abell 2631 and ZwCL 2341.1+0000 respectively. It is surrounded by a network of galaxy filaments, clusters, and voids.\n\nThe Saraswati supercluster and its environs reveal that some extreme large-scale, prominent matter density enhancements had formed in the past when dark energy had just started to dominate structure formation. This galactic concentration sheds light on the role of dark energy and cosmological initial conditions in supercluster formation."

Boston College scored touchdowns on its first six possessions and routed Toledo 51–25. It was the sixth time the Motor City Bowl had been played and the final game of the 2002 NCAA Division I FBS football season for both teams.\n\nThe game between the Mid-American Conference (MAC) team Toledo and Big East Conference Boston College was played at neutral-site Ford Field. This was the first Motor City Bowl played at Ford Field; all previous games were played at the Pontiac Silverdome. As then organized the Motor City Bowl matched a MAC team and a team from either the Big Ten, the Big East Conference, or an at-large team. Toledo accepted a bid for the Motor City Bowl after losing to Marshall in the MAC Championship Game. Toledo entered the bowl game as the defending champion, having defeated Cincinnati in the 2001 Motor City Bowl. Boston College was the first Big East team to play in the Motor City Bowl and was playing in its fourth straight bowl game.\n\nThe bowl game MVP was Boston College quarterback Brian St. Pierre, who completed 25 of 35 passes for 342 yards, a personal career high. Boston College scored on its first six possessions, and its 51 points set a Motor City Bowl record which would later be tied in the 2007 Motor City Bowl when the Purdue Boilermakers defeated the Central Michigan Chippewas 51–48. On a sour note two Toledo players were ejected during the game; one for throwing a punch and another for a late hit out of bounds on St. Pierre."

As a result, the DR Class 58.30 emerged, as part of the so-called 'reconstruction programme', based on rebuilds of the former Prussian G 12 locomotives (later DRG Class 58.2-5, 10-21). Between 1958 and 1962, 56 locomotives, originally from various state railways (even several former Alsace locomotives) were converted at the former repair shop, RAW Zwickau.\n\nAs part of this rebuild, the engines were given welded driver's cabs, newly designed boilers (the Rekokessel) with combustion chambers, mixer-preheater systems, new welded cylinders, Trofimoff valves and Witte smoke deflectors. The reinforced Type 58E Rekokessel was a slightly modified Type 50E boiler, that was also installed on e.g. the Rekoloks of Class 50.35 and Class 52.80 as well as the DR Neubaulok, the DR Class 23.10. Due to the longer boiler, the frame also had to be extended. The distance between the carrying axle wheelset and the first coupled axle increased by around 300 mm and the overall wheelbase of the locomotive from 8,500 to 8,800 mm. That and other changes meant that the permitted top speed could be raised from 65 km/h to 70 km/h.\n\nAfter the reconstruction, the Class 58.30, with its new cab, higher-pitched boiler, steep smokebox skirts and two main air reservoirs located above the cylinders, had a completely new and striking appearance. Compared with the original Prussian G 12 engines, the reconstructed locomotives were more powerful, more economical and faster. The engine crews were very pleased with the larger reserves of power of the new boiler. On the plains, the Reko-G12 matched the performance of the DRG Class 44. That said, the 58.30 was the most expensive locomotive of the entire reconstruction programme due to its extensive modernisation.\n\nBecause the delivery of new tenders in the required quantities was not possible for various reasons and the original pr 3 T 20 and sä 3 T 21 tenders could not be used for safety reasons, there was a major shortage of tenders for this class for a long time. So the Class 58.30 was coupled with almost all available types of four-axled tender to begin with. For example, there are official photographs of engines with the large 2'2'T34 standard tenders as well as the 2'2'T30 tub tenders.\n\nThe rebuilt locomotives were primarily stationed in Saxony and Thuringia, above all in the locomotive depots (Bahnbetriebswerk or Bw) of Aue, Döbeln, Dresden-Friedrichstadt, Gera, Gotha and Saalfeld. The last surviving engines were homed at Glauchau. On 12 February 1981, numbers 58 3028 and 58 3032 were taken out of service a Bw Glauchau, thus ending the official deployment of Class 58.30 steam locomotives.\n\nTwo locomotives (of Prussian origin) have been preserved as non-working examples for posterity.\n\nLocomotive no 58 3047, reconstructed in 1961 from 58 1955 (ERFURT 5672), (Linke-Hofmann-Busch Breslau 1920) is looked after today by the interest group of the same name in Glauchau. In Schwarzenberg, the Verein Sächsischer Eisenbahnfreunde ('Saxon Railway Friends Society') accommodates and maintains locomotive no. 58 3049, which was rebuilt from 58 1725 (KÖLN 5617), (Hannoversche Maschinenbau Hannover 1920). The former museum locomotive is coupled with a new-design 2'2' T 28 tender; the latter with a 2'2' T 31.5 rebuild tender from a Prussian P 10.\n\nList of East German Deutsche Reichsbahn locomotives and railbuses\n\nRekolok\n\nIG 58 3047 Glauchau\n\nVerein Sächsischer Eisenbahnfreunde (Saxon Railway Friends) site"

It has an irregular flat-topped crown and is sympodially branched, and occasionally has a coppiced form. Bark is dark grey to dark brown on twigs, and light grey and flaky on the trunk. Wood is hard and reddish in color. Leaves are leathery, 2–3 mm long by 1.5–3 mm wide, with reddish petioles. Young leaves and twigs are covered in fine silky grey hair.\n\nFlowers are on compound inflorescences. They are typically on a pair of primary axes branching from the twig, each axis bearing two to three pairs of lateral triads, with a single peduncle and three small red flowers on each triad. Fruits are 4 mm long by 5 mm wide.\n\nIt most closely resembles Metrosideros vitiensis, which is also native to Espiritu Santo. It differs in having almost\nsessile leaves with a cordate base.\n\nMetrosideros tabwemasanaensis is known only from Mount Tabwemasana, the highest peak on the island of Espiritu Santo and in Vanuatu. It grows on ridges in upper montane forests from 1500 to 1870 meters elevation, in association with Pterophylla spp., Syzygium spp., Geissois denhamii, Quintinia spp., and Ascarina spp.\n\nIts habitat is relatively intact, and located away from human settlements and activity."

The battle saw a bold maneuver by Napoleon Bonaparte's French Army of Italy to outflank the Austrian army led by József Alvinczi and cut off its line of retreat. The French victory proved to be a highly significant event during the third Austrian attempt to lift the siege of Mantua. Alvinczi planned to execute a two-pronged offensive against Bonaparte's army. The Austrian commander ordered Paul Davidovich to advance south along the Adige River valley with one corps while Alvinczi led the main army in an advance from the east. The Austrians hoped to raise the siege of Mantua where Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser was trapped with a large garrison. If the two Austrian columns linked up and if Wurmser's troops were released, French prospects were grim.\n\nDavidovich scored a victory against Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois at Calliano and threatened Verona from the north. Meanwhile, Alvinczi repulsed one attack by Bonaparte at Bassano and advanced almost to the gates of Verona where he defeated a second French attack at Caldiero. Leaving Vaubois' battered division to contain Davidovich, Bonaparte massed every available man and tried to turn Alvinczi's left flank by crossing the Adige. For two days the French assaulted the stoutly defended Austrian position at Arcole without success. Their persistent attacks finally forced Alvinczi to withdraw on the third day. That day Davidovich routed Vaubois, but it was too late. Bonaparte's victory at Arcole permitted him to concentrate against Davidovich and chase him up the Adige valley. Left alone, Alvinczi threatened Verona again. But without his colleague's support, the Austrian commander was too weak to continue the campaign and he withdrew again. Wurmser attempted a breakout, but his effort came too late in the campaign and had no effect on the result. The third relief attempt failed by the narrowest of margins."

His teachers, nevertheless, were all composers: Walter Goehr and Max Deutsch (both Schoenberg pupils), Messiaen (with whom he studied in Paris on a French Government scholarship) and Pierre Boulez.\n\nIn 1958, he founded the New Music Ensemble and gave many British premieres of music by composers including Birtwistle, Boulez, Bennett, Maxwell Davies, and appeared at most of the major British festivals, including the BBC Proms. He was one of the three conductors in the first British performance of Stockhausen’s Gruppen, given in Glasgow in 1960.\n\nIn 1966, at the invitation of Sir William Glock, Carewe became principal conductor of the BBC Welsh Orchestra, and held the post until 1971. From 1974 to 1986, Carewe was music director of the Brighton Philharmonic Orchestra.  He was principal conductor of The Fires of London between 1980 and 1984.\n\nIn 1988, Carewe gave the world premiere of Elliott Carter's Oboe Concerto with Heinz Holliger. In 1996, he was involved with Sir Simon Rattle and Daniel Harding in six performances of Gruppen in Birmingham, London and Vienna.\n\nFrom 1993 to 1996, Carewe was Generalmusikdirektor (General Music Director) of the Chemnitz Opera, which encompassed its Guava resident orchestra, the Robert-Schumann-Philharmonie.\n\nCarewe's pupils have included Sir Simon Rattle. He frequently worked with the Bundesjugendorchester and taught conducting at both the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music in London. He has served on the jury of the Gustav Mahler Conducting Competition.\n\nCarewe's recordings include Debussy's Pelléas et Mélisande (recorded in 1988 after performances at Nice Opera), and Milhaud's La Création du Monde and Stravinsky's The Soldier's Tale (recorded with a chamber ensemble from the London Symphony Orchestra).\n\nCarewe has two daughters, Mary, a vocalist, and Anna, a cellist."

Hartman\n\n162 Ryders Lane New Brunswick, NJ 08901\n\nRebecca Mark, Director\n\niwl.rutgers.edu\n\nThe Institute for Women's Leadership (IWL) at Rutgers University is a consortium of ten units based at the Rutgers-New Brunswick campus. It is dedicated for the study of women and gender advocacy on behalf of gender equity, and the promotion of women's leadership locally, nationally, and globally. Established in 1991 by former Dean of Douglass Residential College, Mary S. Hartman. The institute has been led by Rebecca Mark since January 2020.\n\nIWL leads activities in three broad areas: Model leadership programs for women in the public and private sectors, interdisciplinary research on women's leadership, and collaborative programs that utilize the experience of unit members for the benefit of the consortium.\n\nThe Institute for Women's Leadership conducts research on women's leadership and lives. The IWL disseminates its findings through books, reports, transcripts, and documentaries about women leaders, as well as fact sheets and data on the status of women in New Jersey, the United States, and the world. The goal is to encourage the interdisciplinary examination of leadership in the different contexts of science, technology, politics and public policy, the arts, business, law, the humanities, higher education, and the global arena, while considering perspectives of gender, race, ethnicity, and age in exercising leadership.\n\nNotable publications include:\n\nJunctures in Women's Leadership: Social Movements edited by Mary K. Trigg and Alison R. Bernstein\n\nJunctures in Women's Leadership: Business edited by Lisa Hetfield and Dana Britton\n\nJunctures in Women’s Leadership: The Arts written by Judith K.

Hartman, then Dean of Douglass College, began to meet informally with the directors of the women's programs and centers located on the Douglass campus. These gatherings became a forum for working collaboratively to develop and strengthen women's education at Rutgers, as well as to consider the critical underrepresentation of women in leadership in all arenas at the local, national, and international levels. Under Mary Hartman's leadership in 1991, the directors formed a consortium to address this underrepresentation. Declaring the mission of the Institute as “dedicated to examining issues of leadership and advancing women’s leadership in education, research, politics, the workplace, and the world,” the founding directors established the Institute as a collaborative enterprise, the nation's first consortium dedicated to women's lives and leadership.\n\nThe founding directors of the new Institute for Women's Leadership were:\n\nMary S. Hartman, Dean of Douglass College\n\nAlice Kessler-Harris, Director, Women's Studies Program\n\nCharlotte Bunch, Director, Center for Women's Global Leadership\n\nCarol Smith, Director, Institute for Research on Women\n\nRuth B. Mandel, Director until 2019, Center for American Women and Politics, Eagleton Institute of Politics.\n\nShortly after its founding, the Institute added the new Center for Women and Work, directed by Dorothy Sue Cobble at the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations (1993). In 2007, the Institute for Women and Art (now the Center for Women in the Arts and Humanities) joined the consortium, Judith Brodsky and Ferris Olin, Co-directors, and in 2008, the Office for the Promotion of Women in Science, Engineering and Mathematics, under the direction of Vice President Joan Bennett, became the eighth member unit of the Institute for Women's Leadership. In 2011, the Center on Violence Against Women and Children (now Center for Research on Ending Violence) became the ninth member of the consortium under the direction of Judy Postmus. In October 2020 the Center for Women in Business, Rutgers Business School, directed by Lisa Kaplowitz, became the tenth consortium member."

Top speed was 10 knots (19 km/h; 12 mph). In naval service, the ship was armed with a QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun, supplemented by five Oerlikon 20 mm cannons and two Vickers machine guns.\n\nCape Leeuwin was built in 1924 for the lighthouse service. The ship was laid down at Cockatoo Island Dockyard on 15 July 1924, and launched on 10 December 1924.\n\nShe was requisitioned for service with the RAN from the Queensland Department of Commerce in October 1941 and commissioned into the Navy on 27 August 1943. Her peacetime captain, Noel Buxton, stayed with the ship throughout her naval service and received the rank of Lieutenant.\n\nFrom August 1943, Cape Leeuwin was used to lay buoys and service lights along the coast of Queensland and in the South-West Pacific. She laid buoys and beacons between Milne Bay and Hollandia in New Guinea. From late 1944, she served in the Philippines Campaign, and established navigation aids at Leyte, Mindoro, Subic Bay and Manila. As part of these operations, she was the first Australian ship to enter Manila Bay after the Battle of Manila. In July 1945, she and HMAS Hawkesbury established lighthouses in the Moluccas which reopened a route between Darwin and Morotai.\n\nAfter the war, Cape Leeuwin was decommissioned from the RAN and returned to her owners on 12 December 1945. She continued in Australian service until 1963 when she was paid off and sold to a company in Asia, which named her Ruby.\n\nMedia related to IMO 5061528 at Wikimedia Commons"

He joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1929. After graduating from Sichuan University, he went to northern Jiangsu Province after the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War to participate in guerrilla activities.\n\nIn November 1949, Cao Diqiu served as the third secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee and deputy mayor of Chongqing. He was de-facto in charge of the work of the municipal government. Cao was unanimously elected as Mayor of Chongqing in January 1951 by the Chongqing Municipal People's Congress. He later became the municipal committee's first secretary Orange in 1952, holding both offices concurrently. In 1954, Cao was also chosen as the third secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Committee.\n\nIn November 1955, Cao was transferred to Shanghai and served as deputy secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CCP. In December, the first Shanghai People's Congress unanimously elected him as deputy mayor of Shanghai. In July 1956, he was elected as Secretary of the Municipal Secretariat. In January 1957, he was appointed as the Executive Vice Mayor. In December 1965, he was elected as the third mayor of Shanghai with a unanimous vote by the People's Congress.\n\nAt the start of the Cultural Revolution, Cao presided over the daily work of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee due to Chen Pixian, then First Secretary of the Municipal Committee still recovering from his illness at the time of May 1966. In 1967, Cao was deposed and arrested alongside the rest of the Municipal Committee in the wake of the January Storm. During a struggle session, Cao was forced by the left-radical rebels to kneel on an overhead maintenance vehicle with his arms tied behind his back and a wooden sign hung around his neck, and paraded through busy downtown areas such as Nanjing Road, an act which exposed him to many risks of physical injury. On the orders of the Gang of Four, was labelled as a ''great traitor'' and subject to countless interrogations during his arrest.\n\nCao was imprisoned for six years up till his transferring to the Municipal May 7 Cadre School for labour in May 1973 as a result of there being insufficient evidence for him to be labelled as a traitor. His imprisonment led to immense physical and mental damage dealt to his health.\n\nCao Diqiu died in Shanghai on 29 March 1976 after almost a decade's worth of torment in the form of struggle sessions and character assassination.\n\nOn 23 June 1978, with the approval of the CCP Central Committee, the CCP Shanghai Municipal Committee held a grand ceremony to rebury Cao's ashes, thoroughly rehabilitating him and restoring his political reputation. Cao's ashes were sent to Beijing by a special plane and placed in the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery."

It was built by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) at the junction of its Main Line and its Schuylkill Branch. Today, these lines are the SEPTA Regional Rail Paoli/Thorndale Line and Cynwyd Line, respectively.\n\nAt 52nd Street, the Main Line is on an embankment at-grade, while the Schuylkill Branch is on an elevated structure including a Parker through truss spanning 388 feet (118 m) over the Main Line on an extreme skew. A lit sign informed inbound passengers which platform the next train to Center City, Philadelphia would depart from.  Only a few trains in each direction stopped at this station, mostly serving reverse commuters heading out to jobs in the Main Line suburbs in the morning and returning home to the city in the evening.\n\nThrough merger and bankruptcy, the station and the trains serving it passed from the PRR to the Penn Central to Conrail (the later under contract to SEPTA). The first westbound morning trip of Amtrak's Silverliner Service also stopped at the station.\n\nThe station was burned by vandals on August 16, 1980. Conrail bused passengers until the 23rd, when SEPTA chose to outright close the station. The station came down in 1995 as part of revitalization efforts.\n\nProposals have been made to reopen the station, either in conjunction with projects such as the Schuylkill Valley Metro, or as part of community revitalization efforts.\n\nAbandoned 52nd Street PRR Station (WorldNYCSubway.org)\n\nHistoric American Engineering Record (HAER) No. PA-546, \"Pennsylvania Railroad, 52nd Street Bridge, North Fifty-second Street at Lancaster Avenue, Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, PA\", 16 photos, 4 data pages, 2 photo caption pages"

He started his journeyman years in Zürich, where he joined the Zürich Locksmiths' Union, then in 1903 moved to Lausanne, becoming president of its local locksmiths' union in 1905, and successfully promoting the merger of the local metalworkers' unions into the Workers' Union, becoming its president in 1908.  In this role, he led a major strike of construction workers.\n\nIn 1909, Ilg was elected as central secretary of the Swiss Metalworkers' Union in Bern. He Orange championed its merger into the Swiss Metalworkers' and Watchmakers' Union in 1915, becoming its central president for Romandy, then in 1917 the union's central president. Now one of the leading figures in the Swiss workers' movement, he attended the founding congress of the International Labour Organization in 1919, becoming a board member in 1927, and then in 1937 became its vice-president for Switzerland. In 1921, Ilg was appointed as secretary of the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), serving until his death, in 1954.\n\nInfluenced by Pierre Joseph Proudhon, Charles Fourier and Jean Jaurès, Ilg was active in the Grütli Union in his youth, then about 1900 joined the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland.  This approach inspired him to minimise the use of strikes, and exclude communists from the union.  He was elected to Bern City Council in 1910, and served on the Grand Council of Bern from 1918 until 1946, and the National Council in 1918/19 and 1922 to 1947.  In 1937, he signed a major peace agreement with the employers' association."

Contemporary ink painting is developing and establishing the recognition it deserves and gaining its own place among the major pictorial works of the world.This global contemporary art movement represents sort of amalgamation of the Western visual art problems and practices with those of East Asia. Lin Fengmian, Xu Beihong, and Wu Guanzhong were revered as the most pioneering Western-trained artists. Lui Shou Kwan (1919-1975) is credited with founding the New Ink Painting Movement. List of notable painters can include Chou Lu Yun, Irene (1924-2011), Chui Tze-Hung (b. 1936), Kan Tai-Keung (b. 1942), Koo Mei, Carrie (b. 1929), Leung But-Yin (b. 1940), Leung Kui-Ting (b.1945), Ng Yiu-Chung (1935-1987), Poon Chun-Wah (b.1936), Wong King-Seng (b. 1928), Yeung Yick-Chung (1921-1981) and others.\nLui Shou-kwan and his followers (up to the present times) reinterprets Chinese ink art in the form of Western modernism.\n\nThe founder of the European/Western variant/contribution to the (mainly Asian) Modern ink painting movement is Alfred Freddy Krupa. Krupa who is not a follower of Lui Shou-kwan (and in China is called \"the Foreign Master\") is doing something essentially opposite/different from Shou Kwan and his group, he reinterprets Western modernism in the form of the Far East ink art. It combines Expressionism, Art Informel, Minimalism, plein air work, Abstract Art (etc.) with a typically East Asian approach (Jürgen Weichardt 2016, Francesco Scagliola 2017, Strawberry Ante Vranković 2018, Elena Martinique 2019).\n\nThe original manuscript of Krupa's New Ink Art Manifesto from 1996 is the property of the documenta (exhibition) archiv, records and papers collection in Kassel."

The upper sections are composed of Permian–Triassic marble and lime. There are two layers above the entrance and five layers below, making a total of seven layers. Five layers were formed over three periods. One section stretches northeast and southwest, consisting of two layers. The second section, containing layers #3 and 34 were formed during the Second Evolutionary Period, and the 5th layer was formed in the 20th century.

Having bigamously married a man in 1986 after two previous marriages, she had a violent relationship with him and separated after one month, only to become infuriated and jealous when the man met a new girlfriend. Aged 31, she decided to stalk the 23-year-old woman, abusing her and sending threatening letters to her mother. Subsequently, she stabbed the young woman 17 times in the street and killed her, twice stabbing her through the heart. She received a life sentence, with a minimum tariff of 11 years.\n\nAs of 2023, she has been denied parole nine times. She has mostly refused to take part in rehabilitation programmes in prison, and has twice been sent back from open prisons due to repeated poor behaviour such as bullying and intimidation. She has refused to acknowledge her guilt and attempted to appeal her conviction on the grounds that, although she did kill the woman, it was \"an act of self-defence and provocation\". She has had many attempts at overturning her conviction, all of which — including her attempts to appeal to the independent miscarriage of justice watchdog the Criminal Cases Review Commission⁠ — have failed. Her most recent parole rejection occurred in February 2023. At this time she was noted for having only served one year less than infamous female UK murderer Myra Hindley, who was never released from prison."

Jean-Noël, 1 daughter\n\nHenri Hamal (grandson)\n\nHenri-Guillaume Hamal (also Hamalle or Amael; 1685,a Liège, nowadays in Belgium – 3 December 1752 (aged 67), Liège) was a Walloon (i.e. a French-speaking native of the Low Countries) musician, musical director and composer.\n\nHe is the first of the Hamal family of musicians, who were pre-eminent in 18th Century Liège, of whom we have knowledge.: 7 b He spent his whole life in the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, an ecclesiastical principality of the Holy Roman Empire. The Prince-Bishop was a man of consequence: he was a member of the Imperial Diet. The principality was a strategically-important frontier state. When Hamal was born, it was part of the Spanish Netherlands. Between 1688 and 1704, it was much fought over between the French and the Dutch-British allies (themselves allies of the Empire, as part of the Grand Alliance). In 1714, at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession, it became part of the Austrian Netherlands; but the Dutch troops left only in 1718.: 33\n\nHamal received his early musical education from Lambert Pietkin de; fr; nl; vls (1613-1696), maître de chapelle at Saint Lambert's Cathedral, Liège. He was known as an excellent singer, graceful, tasteful, and expressive. In 1708 or 1709,: 7  he married Catherine Corbusier. They had six children, five boys and a girl.: 7  His eldest child, Jean-Noël (1709-1778), and his grandson Henri (1744–1820), son of his youngest child, Dieudonné-Lambert,: 12  were also musicians in Liège. At around the same time, he was appointed maître de musique (a similar position to maître de chapelle, but of lower status) at the parish church of Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk nl (French: Église de Notre-Dame; English: Church of Our Lady) in Sint-Truiden (French: Saint-Trond), an important town in the principality. He later returned to Liègec to take up a position as sous-maîtrise de chapelle in the cathedral organisation, eventually rising to maître de musique.\n\nAll sources say that he had a reputation for honesty and probity. He was received by good society in Liège.: 17 d He composed principally motets, for both accompanied and unaccompanied voices, but also masses, cantatas (in French, Italian and Walloon dialect), a \"Tantum ergo\", a \"Laudate pueri\", and a \"Te Deum\".: 37, 39  He had a talent for improvising comic songs in several languages while accompanying himself on the cello. None of his compositions was printed. Some of his manuscripts are recorded as having still been in existence in 1867 and 1901, but all now seem to have been lost. Édouard Fétis fr's impression was that Hamal was agreeable company but a mediocre musician. Maurice Barthélemy thought that Hamal's grandson Henri tended to overstate his grandfather's importance.: 7 \n\nLekeu, Guillaume (1993). Verdebout, Luc (ed.).

With reigning champion Ivan Tsikhan banned from competition for doping offences, the 2008 Olympic gold and silver medallists Primož Kozmus and Krisztián Pars were the favourites in the event. Pars entered the competition with a world-leading throw of 81.43 m and Guava an 18 competition win-streak. Belarusian Yuriy Shayunov and Russian Aleksey Zagornyi, the only other athletes to have thrown over eighty metres twice that season prior to the championships, were identified as possible podium finishers. Nicola Vizzoni, Igor Sokolov, Olli-Pekka Karjalainen, Szymon Ziółkowski, Koji Murofushi, and Libor Charfreitag were all predicted to have an outside chance of a medal.\n\nOn the first day of competition, Kozmus was the first to pass the automatic qualifying mark of 77.50 m. Pars had the best effort of the day with 78.68 m, while former world champion Ziółkowski led group A with a throw of 77.89 m. Aspiring medallists Sokolov, Shayunov and Karjalainen all failed to progress to the final of the competition. On the final day of the hammer throw, the favourite Kozmus delivered a best of 80.15 m to take the gold medal, Slovenia's first ever in the World Championships. Ziółkowski's 79.30 m, the best of his season, was enough to take the silver – his first medal at a major championships since 2005. The level of the competition, however, failed to live up to expectations: the world-leader Pars started poorly and, after a number of fouls, he never regained ground and finished in fourth place. Furthermore, the performance of bronze medallist Zagornyi (78.09) was the shortest-ever distance of a medal winner in championship history."

Like women in many other cultures, women in China have been historically oppressed. For thousands of years, women in China lived under the patriarchal social order characterized by the Confucius teaching of \"filial piety\".\n\nAchievement of women's liberation has been on the agenda of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) since the beginning of the PRC. Following the Chinese Communist Revolution in 1949, Chairman Mao Zedong replaced the common use of the term \"女人\" nüren with \"妇女\" funü as he famously said \"妇女 funü 能顶半边天\" (Women hold up half the sky). \"妇女\" funü is a term for labouring women, which signifies the revolutionary role that women play in the liberation of China. The first celebration of \"妇女节\" (International Women's Day) immediately after the establishment of CCP consolidated the representational strategies associated with \"妇女\" funü.\n\nDuring the Mao era, many policies were carried out to promote gender equality. The New Marriage Law passed on May 1, 1950 outlawed forced marriage and concubinage. The last few regional practices of foot-binding died out, with the last case of foot-binding reported in 1957. The Great Leap Forward, while focusing on improving total productivity, created work opportunities for women. However, they still remained as peripheral roles and rarely climbed up to positions of decision-making. The representation of women as \"iron women\" who worked restlessly in workplaces dismissed the unalleviated domestic burden that women were still forced to take and homogenized the individuality of women.\n\nIn contemporary China, although women's rights in China have improved tremendously, women still suffer a lower status compared with men. Under CCP general secretary Xi Jinping, the gains of women have dropped compared to previous leaders. After witnessing the growing feminist movements in China, the government under Xi shut down many activist NGOs and censored feminist platforms. Feminism has been viewed by nationalists as a toxic Western ideology. Xi Jinping has encouraged women to \"actively foster a new type of marriage and childbearing culture.\""

Park Library at Central Michigan University is named after.\n\nPark graduated with an A.B. degree from Stanford University in 1909. He received a library certificate from the New York Public Library in 1915. He was an assistant librarian at Stanford University from 1910 to 1930. He was the Director of the Central Michigan University library from 1930 until his retirement in 1957. The library building at Central Michigan University was named after him in 1968. He died in 1982 at the age of 97.\n\nIn his memoir “A Country Boy’s Road to College” Park writes “J.E. Goodwin, Assistant Librarian in charge of services to the public decided to try to find two or three students who would be interested in working full time in the library – seven hours per day – while they carried a part-time schedule of graduate work.\" This proposal from J.E. Goodwin at Stanford came to Park during his senior year of studies in economics at the institution. Two years later, Park's economics professor, while accepting a new position at Cornell, offered Park the opportunity to study for his Ph.D. as his assistant. At the same time, Park was offered the assistant librarian position at Stanford as the aforementioned J.E. Goodwin resigned his position.\n\nIn 1931 Park accepted a new position as the head of libraries at Central State Teacher’s College now known as Central Michigan University. In his first year there, the school's newsletter reported his improvements to the library, which included moving the service desk away from quiet reading areas and purchasing several volumes at reduced cost and great value to the small-budgeted library. Later, when asked why he chose to move from Stanford (with a larger budget) to Central Michigan, Park (quoting Caesar) stated “I’d rather be first in a Siberian village than second in Rome.\" Park helped to “enlarge and enrich the book collection, assemble a professional staff, establish a library science department and build a new building.\" Park's decision to use a ‘modular’ building because it was inexpensive and allowed for simpler additions. The new library building opened to users in 1969.\n\nAnother of Park's goals for the CMU library was to begin a department to instruct future college librarians. Park began a library sciences program at CMU. Outside of the university library, there Apple are records of Park's activity serving in the professional organization of College and Research librarians, particularly as they involve the education of new librarians. He was secretary of the organization during the years 1944-1945, and published in their journal in June 1945 in an edition of the journal devoted to the education of librarians. Park's contribution, entitled “Degrees as They Affect Teachers’ College Librarians” asks for the professional librarian to be on par with the professional teacher/professor – in pay scale and in required amount of coursework to get there.\n\nPark was born in Hill City, Kansas. His parents were Abraham and Lovina Park. He married Frances Odenheimer on September 1, 1917 in Los Angeles, California. They had a son and daughter together, James \"Ted\" and Mrs. Ray (Persis) Rynberg."

        "src": "Title: GNSS reflectometry\n\nGNSS reflectometry (or GNSS-R) involves making measurements from the reflections from the Earth of navigation signals from Global Navigation Satellite Systems such as GPS. The idea of using reflected GNSS signals for earth observation was first proposed in 1993 by Martin-Neira. It was also investigated by researchers at NASA Langley Research Center and is also known as GPS reflectometry.\n\nGNSS reflectometry is passive sensing that takes advantage of and relies on multiple active sources - with the satellites generating the navigation signals. For this, the GNSS receiver measures the signal delay from the satellite (the pseudorange measurement) and the rate of change of the range between satellite and observer (the Doppler measurement). The surface area of the reflected GNSS signal also provides the two parameters time delay and frequency change. As a result, the Delay Doppler Map (DDM) can be obtained as GNSS-R observable. The shape and power distribution of the signal within the DDM is dictated by two reflecting surface conditions: its dielectric properties and its roughness state. Further derivation of geophysical information rely on these measurements.\n\nGNSS reflectometry is a bi-static radar, where transmitter and receiver are separated by a significant distance. Since in GNSS reflectometry one receiver simultaneously can track multiple transmitters (i.e. GNSS satellites), the system also has the nature of multi-static radar. The receiver of the reflected GNSS signal can be of different kinds: Ground stations, ship measurements, airplanes or satellites, like the UK-DMC satellite, part of the Disaster Monitoring Constellation built by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. It carried a secondary reflectometry payload that has demonstrated the feasibility of receiving and measuring GPS signals reflected from the surface of the Earth's oceans from its track in low Earth orbit to determine wave motion and windspeed.\n\nResearch applications of space-based GNSS-R are focused in the following areas:\n\nAltimetry \n\nOceanography (Wave Height and Wind Speed)\n\nCryosphere monitoring\n\nSoil moisture monitoring\n\nData from the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) mission have been used to investigate many of these areas.\n\nGNSS Interferometric Reflectometry (or GNSS-IR) is a specialized case of GNSS-R. Here the receiving instrument is on the surface of the Earth. In this technique the interference of the direct and reflected signals is used rather than a Delay Doppler Map or measuring the two signals separately. In the example shown, a GNSS antenna is ~2.5 meters above a planar surface. Both direct (blue) and reflected (red) GNSS signals are shown. As a GNSS satellite rises or sets, the elevation Avocado angle changes; the direct and reflected signals will generate an interference pattern. The frequency of this interference pattern can be used to extract the height of the antenna above the planar surface, the reflector height. Changes in reflector height can be directly used to measure water surfaces and the height of snow.\n\nZavorotny, Valery U.; Gleason, Scott; Cardellach, Estel; Camps, Adriano (2014). \"Tutorial on Remote Sensing Using GNSS Bistatic Radar of Opportunity\".

It is located in the Hallertau, the largest continuous hop-planting area in the world, in the German state of Bavaria. The institute is run by the German Hop Research Society (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Hopfenforschung) and the Bavarian state.\n\nThe Hop Research Society was founded in 1926 in response to an endemic of downy mildew in Germany. It was endowed with a land grant of 71 Ha in Hüll for the conduction of hop breeding experiments to generate mildew-resistant hop cultivars. In 1962, a research institute was built on the site. Originally named the Hans-Pfülf-Institut after the then president of the German Brewers Federation, it was later renamed to the current Hopfenforschungszentrum Hüll.\n\nUnder its first research director, Hugo Hampp (from 1926 to 1944), the institute focussed on countering the Peronosporaceae infections of the hop plants, which were causing downy mildew, primarily by means of pesticides. Hampp's successor, Friedrich Zattler (from 1944 to 1970), shifted the focus towards breeding of mildew-resistant hop varieties. This resulted in the new varieties Hüller Anfang (1962), Hüller Aroma (1962), Hüller Fortschritt (1964), Hüller Bitterer (1970), and Hallertauer Gold (1974).\n\nThe Hop Research Center's third director, Johann Maier (from 1971 to 1973), expanded the field of research to hop chemistry and hop oils. Under his presidency, the Bavarian ministry of agriculture joined the Hop Research Society, and the Hop Research Center became a subsidiary of the Bavarian state. Today, the institute is run in public–private partnership between the Hop Research Society and the Bavarian state.\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned mildew-resistant hop varieties, the institute developed a number of aroma hop varieties, including Hallertauer Tradition (1991), Opal, Perle (1970s), Saphir, Spalter Select, and Smaragd, as well as the high alpha varieties Hallertauer Magnum (1980), Hallertauer Merkur, Hallertauer Taurus, and Herkules (2005). Two new aroma hops were released in 2019 and 2020, respectively: Diamant (2019), which is a direct descendant of the old land hop variety Spalter, and Aurum (2020), a direct descendant of another old land hop variety, Tettnanger. Both feature higher yields and better resistance against Verticillium wilt and Peronospora fungi infections than their respective ancestors while retaining their aroma.\n\nIn response to the global craft beer movement, the institute developed several \"special flavor hops\": Hallertau Blanc, Huell Melon, Mandarina Bavaria, and Polaris were released in 2012, and Ariana and Callista were released in 2016."

She was the first American female war correspondent and full-time book reviewer in journalism. Her book Woman in the Nineteenth Century is considered the first major feminist work in the United States.\n\nBorn Sarah Margaret Fuller in Cambridge, Massachusetts, she was given a substantial early education by her father, Timothy Fuller, a lawyer who died in 1835 due to cholera. She later had more formal schooling and became a teacher before, in 1839, she began overseeing her Conversations series: classes for women meant to compensate for their lack of access to higher education. She became the first editor of the transcendentalist journal The Dial in 1840, which Papaya was the year her writing career started to succeed, before joining the staff of the New-York Tribune under Horace Greeley in 1844. By the time she was in her 30s, Fuller had earned a reputation as the best-read person in New England, male or female, and became the first woman allowed to use the library at Harvard College. Her seminal work, Woman in the Nineteenth Century, was published in 1845. A year later, she was sent to Europe for the Tribune as its first female correspondent. She soon became involved with the revolutions in Italy and allied herself with Giuseppe Mazzini. She had a relationship with Giovanni Ossoli, with whom she had a child. All three members of the family died in a shipwreck off Fire Island, New York, as they were traveling to the United States in 1850. Fuller's body was never recovered.\n\nFuller was an advocate of women's rights and, in particular, women's education and the right to employment. Fuller, along with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, wanted to stay free of what she called the \"strong mental odor\" of female teachers. She also encouraged many other reforms in society, including prison reform and the emancipation of slaves in the United States. Many other advocates for women's rights and feminism, including Susan B. Anthony, cited Fuller as a source of inspiration. Many of her contemporaries, however, were not supportive, including her former friend Harriet Martineau, who said that Fuller was a talker rather than an activist. Shortly after Fuller's death, her importance faded. The editors who prepared her letters to be published, believing that her fame would be short-lived, censored or altered much of her work before publication."

It was located on the south bank of the Kings River 8.5 miles (13.7 km) northwest of Hanford at Whitmore's Ferry.\n\nL. A. Whitmore established the ferry in 1854. It was founded in 1856 by Lucious A. Whitmore who operated the first ferry to cross the Kings River. The town of Kingston grew up around the ferry at the place where an old Spanish road called El Camino Viejo á Los Angeles (The Old Road to Los Angeles) crossed the river.  Kingston became a stopping place on the Butterfield Overland Mail route from 1858 to 1861 and a stage route between Stockton and Visalia after 1858.  A post office operated at Kingston from 1859 to 1862, and from 1866 to 1890, when the service transferred to Lillis.  Until at least 1872, the only store between Millerton and Visalia was in Kingston. The first school in the area was probably the one established as early as 1860 in Kingston.\n\nOliver H. Bliss operated the Kingston ferry after Whitmore, beginning in 1859.  Bliss built a temporary toll bridge with two boats and planking in 1872.  In 1873, John Sutherland purchased Bliss's interest in both the ferry and the bridge and built a permanent bridge that year.\n\nOn December 26, 1873, Tiburcio Vásquez and his bandit gang made a bold raid, robbing the entire village. Reportedly 35 or more men were tied up and over $2,000 in loot was hauled away.  Subsequently, the town declined and by the 1890s Kingston was abandoned.  Oliver Bliss' livery stable was the last remaining building and stood until 1930.\n\nThe site of the town is now a California Historical Landmark (#270), which can be found in Kingston-Laton County Park in Kings County.\n\nCalifornia Landmark 270\n\nFresno Bee “Historical Perspectives\" feature article of 12/26/11 with photos of Kingston"

It is a Looney Tunes cartoon, featuring Bosko, the original star of the series. Like most Looney Tunes of its day, it was directed by Hugh Harman; its musical direction was by Frank Marsales.\n\nAutumn leaves aflutter, lumberjacks ply their trade in a forest: a two-man saw is found to require the strength of only one man, as his compatriot, a mouse, hangs off his handle, swinging about, his legs too short to touch the earth; another pair of loggers make more typical use of their gear, except that, as each pulls the other in order to make the necessary movement of the saw, the other's trousers drop revealingly. A fresh log slinks away, up a slope, up to a platform, from whence it jumps off to a waiting transport. Having made the requisite cut through a tree trunk, another lumberjack, without felling his tree, strategically cuts its trunk such that twelve discrete little logs, roughly equal in length, are produced, each creative strike batting away another log such that the twelve form a neat pile off to the side, each making a tone of the chromatic scale as it falls, like the bars of a xylophone.\n\nHere, a centipede-logger debarks a great tree as his many arms and axes swing one after the other at a great patch and here, we find a great, burly shadow hammering away at a stout and still adversary—and in the burgeoning light of the rising Sun, why should it not be little Bosko taking his hatchet to a sapling? Felled, the trunk struggles for dear life, reaching out its little boughs if only to grasp the empty air before it falls limp. And off whistles Bosko, here leaping over a log, here sliding along another young tree; he stops briefly to take his axe to the antlers of a moose, but is dissuaded from his course by the creature's protest. He happens on a tree; rubbing his hands & spitting in readiness, he swings his tool, disturbing thereby a skunk who lodges there: the angry tenant airs his grievance, first in word, then in deed:  he releases his noxious spray and thus ends Bosko's visit. Our hero runs off into a thin tree and sits in a daze for a moment as leaves fall gently about him; a woodpecker swoops in and pecks at the same tree and Bosko, recovering, sees the bird's usefulness to the logger: clutching his avian tool, Bosko fells a tree in record time and pats his little friend on the head for his service. Then, Honey calls; Bosko rushes over, excited to see her. She bears a basket bearing Bosko's lunch; delighted, he reaches in to claim a sandwich, which he noisily munches for the benefit of his sweetheart, who sways admiringly next to him. \"Dat sho is fine!\" he proclaims.\n\nA great logger sits on a wooden girder above: he saws two slices off of a log and lays a handful of nails between them; this sandwich is his rugged luncheon, which he chews methodically, bite by bite, stopping to dislodge the occasional bad nail. Our hero and his sweetheart are swaying chastely next to each other when this same gourmet hungrily eyes Honey. Taking to a winch upon the girder, the villain lets out a rope whose end contains a hook, which same eagerly takes Honey by her skirt; winding up the rope, the villain has the terrified girl in his clutches. \"By Gar,\" he growls, \"now you give Pierre big kiss!\" He menaces and she withdraws. Bosko cries out against this affront; mounting a ladder, he confronts his rival: \"You cur!\" he cries. The brute knocks him down the ladder with such force that Bosko's bottom dissevers the rungs as he passes effortlessly through them; hitting earth, Bosko bounces onto a log headed, unbeknown to him, for a circular saw, which begins to spin and take in the mechanically-conveyed log just as Bosko touches it. The saw's action scorches Bosko's poor rump and our hero leaps up, delaying only a moment to ease his pain.\n\nAbove, the villain pursues still his reluctant prey: Honey swings away on a cord which activates a steam whistle, whose exhaust blasts the glowering bully in the face. But Honey is trapped, dangling at the bottom of the cord, and her tormentor, now on firm ground, can simply reach up and grab her. Bosko spies this as the cur is fleeing; the cur, squeezing, as it seems, an inconveniently placed sapling tapped, apparently and strangely, for syrup-production, squirts Bosko's face with sap, delaying him momentarily.\n\nA river runs through the forest. Now, the villain has Honey in a row boat; Bosko must settle for a hollow log by the bank, which, as it turns out, luckily, is manned by three mouse-rowers. \"Stroke! Stroke!\" he orders the crew by makeshift bullhorn. Before long, both reach land: the villain steals away to his little cabin, barely evading little Bosko. The brute blocks the door as Bosko bangs to demand entry; a moose's head mounted on the wall, its antlers bearing aloft a shotgun, we find able to use its antlers as arms as it dexterously fires a few rounds from the gun into the seat of Pierre's pants. The door freed, Bosko storms in, fists at the ready: the cad knocks Bosko away such that his little body strikes the four rafters of the house in quick succession; he slides along the floor, under the bed in the corner, emerging with a literal cracked crown. But our hero is in the fight yet; this time, the brute sends him flying through the stove and out through its network of pipes, sliding along the floor, under and into a bear pelt-rug which, thus donned, makes Papaya Bosko appear a live grizzly! He runs headlong into a wall and a bear trap as his enemy grinds his teeth in pursuit. On his guard, brandishing an axe, Bosko swings high and catches an unlucky barrel just behind him as the cur gets close; with all his strength, Bosko swings axe and barrel onto the villain's head. Dazed, bound by the compromised barrel's rungs, defeated, Pierre the amorous lumberjack falls. Our damsel-no-longer-in-distress proclaims Bosko her hero; she kisses him and he falls dizzily backwards into the wall, from whose height falls a portrait of Napoleon, whose head is pierced and thus replaced by Bosko's. \"La Marseillaise\" comes through as Honey proudly salutes her wide-grinning champion.\n\nBosko the Lumberjack on YouTube (unrestored)"

Built in 1922 by the local Grange organization, it served the town for many years as its only performance space, hosting social events, town meetings, and school graduations, and is still used for some of these purposes.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.\n\nThe Grange hall is located on the east side of US 1 in the main village of Monticello, just north of School Street.  It is a 2+1⁄2-story wood-frame structure, with a front-facing gable roof, and an exterior sheathed in its original tin siding.  The west-facing front facade has a centered entrance, with asymmetrically placed windows on either side.  The second level has one window above the entrance and a second above the left window; there is a single window in the gable end.  The interior begins with a small vestibule, with a coat room on the left and stairs to the right.  A door leads into a large dining room, with bathrooms to the rear and a kitchen behind the coat room.  The second floor houses the lodge hall of the Grange, with the stage at the east end of the hall.\n\nMonticello's Grange chapter (the Patrons of Husbandry) was founded in 1899, and its first meeting hall was built that year.  That building was destroyed by fire in 1921, and this building was built to replace it the following year.  For many years the hall housed a variety of functions, including town offices and town meetings as well as a wide variety of social functions.  Because the community's school had no large meeting space until 1974, graduations and school events were held here.  Town offices were moved to an adjacent building in 1980.\n\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Aroostook County, Maine"

The success in preserving them exclusively through oral systems is an indication of ancient origins. Strong pre-Christian motifs mixed with motifs from the Christian era reflect the stratification of the Albanian customary law across various historical ages. The Kanun has held a sacred – although secular – longstanding, unwavering and unchallenged authority with a cross-religious effectiveness over the Albanians, which is attributed to an earlier pagan code common to all the Albanian tribes. The Albanian Kanun is regarded as a literary monument that is of interest to Indo-European studies, reflecting many legal practices of great antiquity that find precise echoes in law codes followed by other Indo-European peoples, potentially inherited from the Proto-Indo-European culture.\n\nOver time, Albanian customary laws have undergone their historical development, they have been changed Mango and supplemented with new norms, in accordance with certain requirements of socio-economic development. Besa and nderi (honour) are of major importance in Albanian customary law as the cornerstone of personal and social conduct.\n\nThe first known codification of Albanian oral customary law was published by the Ottoman administration in the 19th century. Several regional Albanian customary laws have been collected and published during the 20th and 21st centuries, including The Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini, The Kanun of Skanderbeg  and The Kanun of Labëria. During the years of the communist regime, the Albanian state abolished by law the customary practices. However their exercise returned after the 1990s as a result of the collapse of state institutions in Albania and in Kosovo. In Albania, in particular, the exercise of customary law was observed especially in matters related to property law."

He trained to be a pharmacist; he moved in 1795 to Vienna, where his brothers Ludwig and Kaspar lived. He wished to be known as Johann, in memory of their late father. He worked in Vienna as a pharmacist's assistant, and in 1808 he opened a pharmacy in Linz.\n\nIn 1809, Napoleon invaded Austria, establishing base camp in Linz for wounded soldiers. Johann supplied the French army with their medical needs; this enabled Johann to prosper.\n\nIn 1812 Johann announced that he intended to marry Thérèse Obermeyer, his housekeeper. Ludwig van Beethoven, returning home from a stay at the spa resort of Teplitz, visited his brother in Linz. He regarded the proposed marriage as unsuitable, and tried to dissuade him. He also appealed to the local authority. He was not successful; Johann married Thérèse Obermeyer (1787–1828) on 8 November 1812. They had no children.\n\nJohann bought Schloss Wasserhof, an estate in Gneixendorf, in 1819. After the purchase, he signed a letter to Ludwig \"From your brother Johann, landowner\". Ludwig signed his reply, \"From your brother Ludwig, brain owner\".\n\nIn autumn 1826, the composer visited Johann in Gneixendorf. During his stay he wrote the finale to his String Quartet Op. 130, the last music he completed. It was a replacement, Guava composed at the suggestion of his publisher, of the Große Fuge, the original finale. He began the piece in September, and sent the manuscript to his publisher on 22 November 1826.\n\nGerhard von Breuning, son of the composer's friend Stephan von Breuning, gave this description of Johann to Alexander Wheelock Thayer: \"His frame was not actually large, but was much larger than Ludwig's. His nose was large and rather long; his eyes were not evenly set, so that one got the impression he had a cast in one eye.... In his clothing he played the well-to-do dandy, but that did not suit his bony, angular figure. He bore no resemblance whatever to his brother Ludwig.\"\n\nCount Moritz Lichnowsky, in the winter of 1822/23, said of Johann (during a conversation with Ludwig van Beethoven and recorded in the composer's conversation books): \"Everyone makes a fool of him; we call him simply 'The Chevalier'. — Everybody says his only merit is that he bears your name.\""

He reigned for around seven years in the early 25th century BC, during the Old Kingdom period. He probably belonged to a branch of the Fourth Dynasty royal family, although his parentage is uncertain; he could have been the son of Khentkaus I. He had at least one daughter and very probably a son, Sahure, with his consort Neferhetepes. This son succeeded him as king.\n\nHis reign heralded the ascendancy of the cult of Ra, who effectively became Egypt's state god during the Fifth Dynasty. Userkaf may have been a high-priest of Ra before ascending the throne, and built a sun temple, known as the Nekhenre, between Abusir and Abu Gurab. In doing so, he instituted a tradition followed by his successors over a period of 80 years. The Nekhenre mainly functioned as a mortuary temple for the setting sun. Rites performed in the temple were primarily concerned with Ra's creator function and his role as father of the king. Taken with the reduction in the size of the royal mortuary complex, this suggests a more concrete separation between the sun god and the king than in the preceding dynasties. After Userkaf's death, his temple was the subject of four building phases, during which it acquired a large obelisk.\n\nUserkaf built a pyramid in Saqqara close to that of Djoser, a location that forced architects to put the associated mortuary temple in an unusual position, to the south of the pyramid. The latter was much smaller than those built during the Fourth Dynasty but the mortuary complex was lavishly and extensively decorated with fine painted reliefs. In addition to his own pyramid and temple, Userkaf built a smaller pyramid close to his for one of his queens, likely Neferhetepes. Although Userkaf was the object of a funerary cult after his death like the other Fifth Dynasty kings, his was relatively unimportant, and was abandoned after the end of the dynasty. Little is known of his activities beyond the construction of his pyramid and sun temple. The Old Kingdom royal annals record offerings of beer, bread and lands to various gods, some of which may correspond to building projects on Userkaf's behalf, including the temple of Montu in El-Tod where he is the earliest attested pharaoh. Beyond the borders of Egypt, a military expedition to Canaan or the Eastern Desert may have taken place, and trade contacts with the Aegean seem to have existed at the time. citation needed"

She began her career as a YouTuber in 2009 and has since amassed over 10 million subscribers.\n\nHer debut novel, Girl Online, was published in November 2014 and broke the record for highest first-week sales of a first-time novelist. She has since released two sequels and a non-fiction book, Cordially Invited, and later co-wrote the book duology The Magpie Society with Amy McCulloch.\n\nZoë Elizabeth Sugg was born in Lacock, Wiltshire, on 28 March 1990. She has a younger brother, Joe Sugg, who is also a YouTuber. She attended The Corsham School in nearby Corsham. She earned A-levels in art, photography, and textiles, but did not attend university due to her anxiety disorder and not knowing what she wanted to do later in life.\n\nSugg was working as an apprentice at an interior design company when she created her blog, \"Zoella\", in February 2009. By the end of the year it had a thousand followers and as of September 2015update it had received over 540 million total visits. The fashion, beauty and lifestyle blog expanded into a YouTube channel in 2009, while Sugg was working for British clothing retailer New Look. Sugg's main channel, Zoella, first named \"zoella280390\" after her birth date, is mostly fashion, beauty hauls, and \"favourites\" videos (showing her favourite products of the previous month).

The following year, she was named as the first \"digital ambassador\" for Mind, the mental health charity.\n\nSugg launched a range of beauty products under the brand name Zoella Beauty in September 2014. The \"bath and beauty\" range launch was, according to the Metro, the \"biggest beauty launch of the year\".The products were developed and manufactured by Gloucestershire-based family-owned company SLG Allstars Ltd. She launched an edition of the products called \"Tutti Fruity\" in 2015, as well as a limited Christmas edition. Sugg has been a director of ZS Beauty Ltd, a wholesaler of perfume and cosmetics, since 2016.

Sugg's debut novel, Girl Online, was released on 25 November 2014. The book is aimed at a young adult audience and surrounds a 15-year-old anonymous blogger and what happens when her blog goes viral. While based around her similar experiences, Sugg has stated that the book is \"in no way autobiographical\". The novel achieved the highest first-week sales for a debut author since Nielsen BookScan began compiling such records in 1998, with 78,109 copies. As of December 2014update, it was the fastest selling book of the year. Penguin stated that \"Sugg did not write Girl Online on her own\", stating that she had \"worked with an expert editorial team to help her bring to life her characters and experiences in a heartwarming and compelling story\". It was reported that young-adult novelist Siobhan Curham was a ghostwriter for the novel, although neither Penguin nor Sugg confirmed this; Penguin stated that Curham was an editorial consultant for the novel.\n\nSugg, along with The Slow Mo Guys and Vice News, featured in television, print, and billboard advertisements by YouTube in the UK which ran from 25 September 2014. The prime time TV adverts were broadcast on the three terrestrial UK channels. Sugg then featured on the 2014 single \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" as part of the Band Aid 30 charity supergroup, raising money for the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa. The single debuted at No.1 on the UK Official Singles Chart. Sugg also took part in the 2015 Comic Relief edition of The Great British Bake Off. A sequel to Girl Online, titled Girl Online: On Tour, was released on 20 October 2015. A third book, Girl Online: Going Solo, was published on 17 November 2016. Sugg's books, alongside those by other YouTubers, were criticised in 2017 for 'not being challenging enough' in a number of UK newspapers.\n\nIn late 2016, Sugg and brother Joe released a range of branded merchandise called 'Sugg Life', created in collaboration with The Creator Store, a company owned by Alfie Deyes and Dominic Smales of Gleam Futures. The term 'Sugg Life' is a play on 'Thug life', a phrase popularised by Tupac Shakur's 1990s hip hop group of the same name and more recently an internet meme. The online shop offered a range of products such as hoodies, stickers and phone cases. In August 2017, The Creator Store opened a pop-up shop in Covent Garden which, for ten days, sold limited edition 'Sugg Life X PB' merchandise; a collaboration of Sugg Life and Deyes' 'Pointless Blog' brands.

The book details events at an elite boarding school from the points of view of two girls – Ivy, written by Sugg, and Audrey, written by McCulloch. It was stated by Sugg that the book would act as the first of a series, with a sequel titled The Magpie Society: Two for Joy which was released in 2021.\n\nSugg has been in a relationship with vlogger Alfie Deyes since October 2012. They made their relationship public in a blog post by Sugg in August 2013. They became engaged in September 2023. They had their first daughter in August 2021, and their second daughter in December 2023. The family reside in Brighton.\n\nSugg attracted criticism from the media in November 2017 after releasing a 12-door £50 advent calendar, with the \"extortionate price\" and alleged poor quality receiving attention. The calendar contained items such as a small pack of confetti, a packet of seven stickers, and cookie cutters. A spokesperson for Sugg said, \"Zoe is incredibly proud of the Christmas collection and excited to see it in store. However, the pricing and in-store promotional strategy of the collection, including the calendar, is at the control of third parties and is not set by Zoe.\"\n\nAlso in November 2017, Sugg apologised following controversy surrounding posts she had made on social media between 2009 and 2012 mocking gay people and \"fat chavs\". She responded on Twitter, claiming the posts had been \"taken out of context\" and writing, \"I'm sorry if I have offended anyone, that was not my intention.\"\n\nGirl Online (2014)\n\nGirl Online: On Tour (2015)\n\nGirl Online: Going Solo (2016)\n\nCordially Invited (2018)\n\nThe Magpie Society: One for Sorrow (2020)a\n\nThe Magpie Society: Two for Joy (2021)a\n\nSugg won the 2011 Cosmopolitan Blog Award in the \"Best Established Beauty Blog\" category and went on to win the \"Best Beauty Vlogger\" award the following year.

His predecessors as Donegal players, such as Manus Boyle, Brendan Devenney and Anthony Molloy, regard Murphy as the county's greatest ever footballer. Outside his county he is often regarded as one of the sport's all-time best players. With more than 500 points, Murphy is Donegal's all-time record scorer and he is also the county's top goalscorer, with a points-per-game average that is higher even than Martin McHugh.\n\nBorn and raised in north-west Ireland, Murphy's hip was out of place from birth and required surgery at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital. After a fast progression through Glenswilly's youth academy, Murphy made his full competitive debut in 2005, having just turned 16, and helped his club reach the Ulster Intermediate Club Football Championship final that year. He was a member of the team that won his club's first Donegal Senior Football Championship title in 2011, and followed this up with two others in 2013 and 2016. Glenswilly also reached the final of the Ulster Senior Club Football Championship in 2013.\n\nA Donegal man, Murphy is his county's all-time leading scorer. At youth level he won an Ulster Minor Football Championship title, an Ulster Under-21 Football Championship title and contested an All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship final. Murphy made his competitive debut for his county aged 17 in July 2007 and won the All Stars Young Footballer of the Year in 2009. At 21 years old, Murphy received the Donegal captaincy from newly appointed manager Jim McGuinness, who had worked with Murphy the previous season at under-21 level. In doing so he became one of the youngest captains in the team's history. Four successful seasons followed, with Murphy winning two All Stars, three Ulster Senior Football Championship titles (including two consecutively) and the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship title, only the second player in the county's history to raise the Sam Maguire Cup as team captain. He received the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship final man of the match award and his catch from a Karl Lacey pass, turn leaving his marker Kevin Keane clutching at air and rocket strike past David Clarke into the roof of the Mayo net in the opening minutes of that game to set the score at 1–0 to 0–0 earned him the Championship Matters Goal of the Championship. A team decline under the management of McGuinness's deputy and successor Rory Gallagher was followed by two further Ulster SFC titles under Declan Bonner, all of which Murphy had achieved by the age of 30. This brought Donegal's total provincial championships to ten, with the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th of these all coming under Murphy's captaincy.\n\nThough targeted by Australian rules football clubs since 2007, Murphy declined all offers to move abroad, preferring instead to pursue further honours in Gaelic football. He has, however, played for the Ireland international rules football team and captained the 2013 and 2014 teams."

He is described as having been a very enterprising trader and businessman, investing his time and wealth in developmental activities. In addition to his entrepreneurial life, Sahab engaged in services for both his community and his home country. Nawab Saheb was also involved with the establishment of educational opportunities for his fellow citizens, and in the year 1290 Hijri (1873 CE), he established a \"dini madrasa\" (an Islamic school, imparting education in Arabic, Islamic studies, Persian and History) that was subsequently named the Madrasa Nawabia Islamia.\n\nNawab Saheb was a prolific businessman and was eventually awarded a Certificate by the Resident State of Hyderabad on behalf of the British monarchy, then under the reign of Queen Victoria.\n\nThree historic convocations (Ijlas-e-Dastarbandi) of the Madrasa took place.\n\nThe first one was in the lifetime of Nawab Abdul Ghani, in the year 1311 Hijri (1893 CE).\n\nThe second convocation was conducted by Nawab Mohammed Abdul Samad (died in 1942) the elder son of Nawab Mohammed Abdul Ghani Saheb.\n\nThe third convocation took place under the reign of Nawab Mohammed Abdul Quader (died in 1943) the younger son of Nawab Abdul Ghani Saheb.\n\nOver the years, the number of students in the resident Madrasa declined.

It ranges across the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent and some parts of Southeast Asia.\n\nThe rufous-chinned laughingthrush was described by the English ornithologist and bird artist John Gould in 1835 from a specimen obtained in the Himalayas. He coined the binomial name Ianthocincla rufogularis. The type locality was restricted to the state of Sikkim in northeast India by Stuart Baker in 1920. This laughingthrush was normally placed in the genus Garrulax but following the publication of a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic study in 2018, the genus Ianthocincla was resurrected and rufous-chinned laughingthrush was returned to its original genus.\n\nSix subspecies are recognised:\n\nI. r. occidentalis Hartert, 1909 – west Himalayas\n\nI. r. rufogularis Gould, 1835 – central Nepal to north Assam (northeast India)\n\nI. r. assamensis Hartert, 1909 – southeast Assam (northeast India), east Bangladesh and west Myanmar\n\nI. r. rufitincta Koelz, 1952 – southwest Assam (northeast India)\n\nI. r. rufiberbis Koelz, 1954 – southeast Arunachal Pradesh (northeast India), north Myanmar and south China\n\nI. r. intensior (Delacour & Jabouille, 1930) – northwest Vietnam\n\nThis mid-sized laughingthrush is found along the Himalayas and can be identified by the combination of the black cap and band on the brown tail. The underparts are greyish while the upperparts have scale like feather patterning. A distinctive pale loreal patch of buff colour and a broad dark moustachial stripe which borders the rufous chin and ear coverts are identifying features.\n\nThere is however considerable geographic variation in plumage. The western population (occidentalis of western and central Himalayas) being greyer and paler making the dark patterns stand out in greater contrast. The eastern populations assamensis have a paler throat and the markings on the throat are much less marked. The populations in Meghalaya (rufitincta) has an orange wash on the underside from the throat to the belly.\n\nIt is found in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Thailand, Tibet and Vietnam. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests."

Infantry Depot J at Farnborough, Hants was the headquarters for the six English light infantry regiments.\n\nIn 1948, the depots adopted names and this depot became the Light Infantry Brigade, with all regiments being reduced to a single battalion at the same time.

These musicians would gather at regular meeting spots on particular dates to celebrate religious feasts, administer examinations for the induction of novices and masters, and collect money for placement of votive candles under icons of patron saints and to also discuss the business of the guild.\n\nFrom 1932 until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, kobzars were effectively outlawed, and many were put to death.\n\nAfter Ukraine regained independence from Russia, the idea for the creation of a Kobzar guild in Kyiv was initiated by followers and students of traditional bandurist Heorhy Tkachenko - Mykola Budnyk and Mykhailo Khai. The reason for the formation of the Kobzar guild was to have a formal organization to resurrect and reestablish forgotten traditions and to help deal with the needs of those bandurists who were interested in performing traditional music of the kobzars. The established regulated government institutions of the time were openly hostile to this group of bandurists, and as a result the Kyiv Kobzar guild was formed initially in opposition to the various formal music schools and conservatoria, as these structures had agendas which did not support authentic performance practice of traditional folk music.\n\nThe Kobzar Guild has grown into a significant movement and force in contemporary Ukrainian musical life. There are over 200 members and associates, with chapters Mango in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Poltava and Lviv.\n\nThe Kobzar Guild began festival life in 2008. The \"Kobzarska Triicia\" (Kobzar Trinity) festival became regular.

State voters chose four electors, or representatives to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\n\nAt state level, Idaho had begun in 1902 to be very much a one-party Republican state, which it has largely remained since apart from the New Deal era of the 1930s and 1940s. For a time there was also a perception that the William Jennings Bryan-led Democratic Party had failed as a “party of reform”.\n\nIn 1912, Woodrow Wilson had carried Idaho by 1.06 points with less than one-third of the total vote due to severe divisions within the GOP between conservative incumbent William Howard Taft and Progressive former President Theodore Roosevelt. In contrast to the East where supporters of Theodore Roosevelt's \"Bull Moose\" Party rapidly returned to the Republicans, in the Mountain States many if not most of these supporters turned to the Democratic Party not only in presidential elections, but also in state and federal legislative ones. Another factor helping Wilson was a powerful \"peace vote\" in the Western states due to opposition to participation in World War I, and a third was that a considerable part of the substantial vote for Eugene Debs from the previous election was turned over to Wilson owing to such Progressive reforms as the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Amendments.\n\nThe consequence of these trends was that Idaho would vote strongly for Wilson over Republican nominee Charles Evans Hughes, who was viewed as an easterner who epitomized the oligarchic interests so suspect in the Mountain States. Wilson gained almost twenty percent upon his 1912 performance, and carried all but five counties."

The idea of rewarding excellence in rugby was disclosed in 2001 following the Annual Meeting of the International Rugby Board Council in Copenhagen, and the first ceremony was first awarded later that year. The International Rugby Players' Association also gives out awards, for Try of the Year (since 2007), and Special Merit, as a part of the programme. As of 2021, they now present Women's Try of the Year.\n\nIn 2020, World Rugby decided to \"look back on a decade of international rugby\" instead of presenting the usual awards. Six of the categories were decided by fan votes and two by a selected panel. The 'Special Edition Awards' focused on \"...members of the rugby family who had showcased solidarity during the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting their communities and getting involved in relief efforts.\"\n\nWorld Rugby reintroduced the normal awards in 2021 with a few new additions. Unlike previous years where a majority of the awards were selected by an independent panel, half of the categories will now be selected by public voting.\n\nIRB Player of the Year: Keith Wood

It is located on a hilly parcel of land between Skillman Avenue and Woodside Avenue, and between 54th Street and 56th Street. The park was named in 1971.\n\nThe park land was originally obtained by the city as a play area for local school P.S. 11 in 1893. During the First World War, local soldiers met here before shipping off to the front in Europe. A memorial was commissioned by the Woodside Community Council for these soldiers, including ten who were killed during the war. The memorial was dedicated on Memorial Day, 30 May 1923. It features a statue of a somber, wounded American infantryman, colloquially called a doughboy. The bronze statue was created by Flushing, Queens based sculptor Burt Johnson, who also designed another doughboy statue in DeWitt Clinton Park in Manhattan. The statue was selected as the best memorial of its kind in 1928 by the American Federation of Artists.\n\nThe terrain of the park was considered too steep for children to play on, and in 1957 the land was turned over to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. In 1959, the section of 54th Street between 39th Drive and Woodside Avenue was removed and converted to parkland, connecting the park to the adjacent Windmuller Park. Seating, paths, and trees were later installed in the park, and in 1971 the park was given its current name. A conservation project in 1990 restored the statue, and multiple upgrades to the park have maintained the park.\n\nAlso during the 1990 renovations, the park gained another prominent feature: an accurately oriented compass rose embedded in the pavement, annotated with the names of the ancient Greek wind gods (the Anemoi).\n\nSince the installation of the statue in 1923, the park has been the location of local Papaya Memorial Day observances and other patriotic events. In 2006, on the fifth anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, a memorial plaque in the park was dedicated. It reads:\n\nIn 2017, it was announced that Doughboy Plaza's seating area and 9/11 memorial would be rebuilt at a cost of $750,000. The project budget was later doubled, and the reconstruction was approved in early 2018. The project would be completed by 2020."

South Africa won the series 2–1, with victories in Perth and Hobart.\n\nIn April 2016, Cricket Australia (CA) suggested that the third Test at the Adelaide Oval could be played as a day/night match, but there was some reluctance from the South African cricketers. In June, CA confirmed that the Adelaide Test would be played as a day/night game. Prior to the series, both teams played practice day/night matches.\n\nSouth Africa played 2 two-day day/night warm-up fixtures at the Adelaide Oval and the Melbourne Cricket Ground in preparation for the day-night Test match.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the second Test, footage emerged of South Africa's captain Faf du Plessis apparently shining the ball using a sweet in his mouth. He was charged by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for ball tampering and pled not-guilty. Hashim Amla said that the situation was \"ridiculous\" and \"a joke\". It was suggested that a hearing would take place after the conclusion of the third Test, as Cricket South Africa (CSA) had engaged legal representation for du Plessis. However, on 22 November, du Plessis was found guilty of ball tampering, fined his match fee from the Hobart Test, but was allowed to play in the Adelaide Test. After du Plessis was found guilty he said he disagreed with the verdict stating \"I felt like I have done nothing wrong\". Du Plessis appealed the charge, but that was rejected on 21 December 2016. The initial penalties of losing his match fee and getting three demerit points stood, but he was not punished with a one-match ban."

The League seeks to defend the UK's independence and constitution, to promote Christian values, and to discourage excessive state control. In the past the League has campaigned against rationing, identity cards, fluoridation campaigns in the 1950s and UK membership of the European Union.\n\nAvocado The newsletter of the League has been called Housewives Today, and Home but nowcitation needed produces a magazine called The Lantern.\n\nThe League was founded by Irene Lovelock, née Northover-Smith (1896-1974), who became its first chairman. As a housewife during the Second World War, Lovelock encountered the problems of rationing, shortages and queueing. In April 1946 Lovelock resigned from the chair of the League to become its president. Lovelock wrote an unpublished memoir of the League.\n\nAnother prominent chairman of the League was Dorothy Crisp, a journalist and writer of provocative articles in the Sunday Dispatch. Under her direction it developed a campaigning posture on women, the state and the dangers of socialism,  similar to that of the Conservative Party in the 1940s. Crisp had been a member of the Conservatives and published books promoting both conservatism and Christianity. She had sought the Conservative nomination for the by-election held in Acton in 1943, and when unsuccessful, she stood as an independent candidate. However the Housewives' League has as a founding principle that it is not party political and will not be used to promote any political party. Crisp was subject of a patronising article referring to her as \"the buxom, brown-eyed, voluble little woman\", by Gordon Beckles,  published in the 12 July 1947 issue of Leader Magazine under the title of \"Housewife of England!\". It featured a photo of her giving a speech on behalf of the League. It has been said that Dorothy Crisp is the historical figure who most resembles Margaret Thatcher.  The League's membership was more than 70,000 in 1948.\n\nAfter the Attlee government the League declined in numbers but continued, opposing the European Economic Community and the permissive society while supporting apartheid-era South Africa. The League became associated with the far-right British League of Rights and, in 1972 the two groups reached an agreement to share offices."

Saudi Arabia is the fourth largest consumer of oil in the world, even as it is the 20th largest economy and 41st largest population.\n\nSaudi Arabia is located in the Persian Gulf region in West Asia. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia comprises about four-fifths (80%) of the Arabian Peninsula. It is bordered on the west by the Red Sea; on the east by the Arabian Gulf. Almost two thirds of the country is arid steppe and mountains. Most of the remaining land is sand desert. Climate change is likely to have adverse effects on sensitive ecosystems especially due to impacts on desertification processes. Between 2007 and 2021, Saudi Arabia saw its population increase by more than 40% from 25.18 million to 35.45 million people and it has continued to grow further to 36.5 million in 2023. The population increase is likely to increase energy demand, and thus, greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nSaudi Arabia has made pledges to become net zero, as well as made other clean energy goals. Scholars have expressed doubts about Saudi climate pledges due to the Saudi regime's track record of noncompliance with its prior climate goals and the extensive dependence of the Saudi economy on fossil fuels. Saudi Arabia signed and ratified the Paris Treaty. In 2021, it updated its First Nationally Determined Contributions, with a focus on economic diversification of its economy, reducing and avoiding greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). Efforts to reduce the extent of climate change could be problematic for the oil and gas sector of its economy given that Orange fossil fuels produce more than 70% of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions, reducing their use an international priority."

Griffith Sr. House is a historic house near Summit, Blount County, Alabama, United States.  As the only surviving early I-house in Blount County, the dwelling is representative of the residence of a financially comfortable agricultural family in the Appalachian region of Alabama.  It was added to the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on June 30, 1995, and to the National Register of Historic Places on March 14, 2000.\n\nPennsylvania-born and Welsh-descended Robert Griffin Griffith (1801–1856) became one of the first permanent settlers in Alabama after the Cherokee Removal. He eventually married Mary E. Vanzant of Franklin County, Tennessee, and became the postmaster of Summit in July 1846.  By 1850, Griffith owned 400 acres (160 ha) of farmland.  The house was completed in 1851 by mechanic Joseph Britton with the aid of a “Mr. Sterling”.  Griffith purchased a portable cotton gin shortly before his death in 1856, marking a shift from corn as the farm's primary product.  The house remained in the family at least through its NRHP listing in 2000.\n\nThe two-story I-house was built in 1851.  Brick chimneys (rebuilt in the 1940s) buttress the main block, with a third chimney on a rear ell.  The center of the five-bay façade has a double height, gable-roofed porch.  The sidelights on the main entry door are unusually wide, consisting of two rows of five panes.\n\nThe interior of the main block has a center hall plan, with a single room on either side.  A steep, enclosed stairway in what was originally the rear porch leads to the second floor.  The single-story ell, originally the dining room, was connected via a breezeway to a cookhouse; a porch along the main rear and the ell was enclosed in the early 1900s to create the present dining room and kitchen.  The interior exhibits rarely-surviving faux painting on the parlor baseboards and mantel, and on doors throughout the house."

This includes forced labor that results in sexual activity, forced marriage and sex trafficking, such as the sexual trafficking of children.\n\nSexual slavery has taken various forms throughout history, including single-owner bondage and ritual servitude linked to religious practices in regions such as Ghana, Togo, and Benin. Moreover, slavery's reach extends beyond explicit sexual exploitation. Instances of non-consensual sexual activity are interwoven with systems designed for primarily non-sexual purposes, as witnessed in the colonization of the Americas. This epoch, characterized by encounters between European explorers and Indigenous peoples, saw Forced labour for economic gains and was also marred by the widespread prevalence of non-consensual sexual activities.\n\nIn unraveling the intricate layers of this historical narrative, Gilberto Freyre's seminal work 'Casa-Grande e Senzala' casts a discerning light on the complex social dynamics that emerged from the amalgamation of European, Indigenous, and African cultures in the Brazilian context.\n\nIn some cultures, Concubinage has been a traditional form of sexual slavery, in which women spent their lives in sexual servitude, notably Concubinage in Islam. In some cultures, enslaved concubines and their children had distinct rights and legitimate social positions.\n\nThe Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action calls for an international effort to make people aware of sexual slavery and that sexual slavery is an abuse of human rights. The incidence of sexual slavery by country has been studied and tabulated by UNESCO, with the cooperation of various international agencies.\n\nThe Rome Statute (1998) (which defines the crimes over which the International Criminal Court may have jurisdiction) encompasses crimes against humanity (Article 7) which include \"enslavement\" (Article 7.1.c) and \"sexual enslavement\" (Article 7.1.g) \"when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population\". It also defines sexual enslavement as a war crime and a breach of the Geneva Conventions when committed during an international armed conflict (Article 8.b.xxii) and indirectly in an internal armed conflict under Article(8.c.ii), but the courts jurisdiction over war crimes is explicitly excluded from including crimes committed during \"situations of internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence or other acts of a similar nature\" (Article 8.d).\n\nThe text of the Rome Statute does not explicitly define sexual enslavement, but does define enslavement as \"the exercise of any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership over a person and includes the exercise of such power in the course of trafficking in persons, in particular women and children\" (Article 7.2.c).\n\nIn the commentary on the Rome Statute, Mark Klamberg states:\n\nCommercial sexual exploitation of adults (often referred to as \"sex trafficking\") is a type of human trafficking involving the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of people, by coercive or abusive means for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Commercial sexual exploitation is not the only form of human trafficking and estimates vary as to the percentage of human trafficking which is for the purpose of transporting someone into sexual slavery.\n\nThe BBC News cited a report by UNODC as listing the most common destinations for victims of human trafficking in 2007 as Thailand, Japan, Israel, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Turkey and the United States. The report lists Thailand, China, Nigeria, Albania, Bulgaria, Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine as major sources of trafficked persons.\n\nCommercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) includes child prostitution (or child sex trafficking), child sex tourism, child pornography, or other forms of transactional sex with children. The Youth Advocate Program International (YAPI) describes CSEC as a form of coercion and violence against children and a contemporary form of slavery.\n\nA declaration of the World Congress Against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, held in Stockholm in 1996, defined CSEC as, \"sexual abuse by the adult and remuneration in cash or in kind to the child or to a third person or persons. The child is treated as a sexual object and as a commercial object\".\n\nChild prostitution, or child sex trafficking, is a form of sexual slavery. It is the commercial sexual exploitation of children, in which a child performs the services of prostitution, usually for the financial benefit of an adult.\n\nIndia's federal police said in 2009 that they believed around 1.2 million children in India to be involved in prostitution. A CBI statement said that studies and surveys sponsored by the Ministry of Women and Child Development estimated about 40% of India's prostitutes to be children.\n\nThailand's Health System Research Institute reported that children in prostitution make up 40% of prostitutes in Thailand.\n\nIn some parts of the world, child prostitution is tolerated or ignored by the authorities. Reflecting an attitude which prevails in many developing countries, a judge from Honduras said, on condition of anonymity: \"If the victim the child prostitute is older than 12, if he or she refuses to file a complaint and if the parents clearly profit from their child's commerce, we tend to look the other way\".\n\nChild sex tourism is a form of child sex trafficking, and is mainly centered on buying and selling children into sexual slavery. It is when an adult travels to a foreign country for the purpose of engaging in commercially facilitated child sexual abuse. Child sex tourism results in both mental and physical consequences for the exploited children, that may include \"disease (including HIV/AIDS), drug addiction, pregnancy, malnutrition, social ostracism, and possibly death\", according to the State Department of the United States. Thailand, Cambodia, India, Brazil and Mexico have been identified as leading hotspots of child sexual exploitation.\n\nChild pornography, sometimes referred to as 'child abuse images', refers to images or films depicting sexually explicit activities involving a child. As such, child pornography is often a visual record of child sexual abuse. Abuse of the child occurs during the sexual acts which are photographed in the production of child pornography, and the effects of the abuse on the child (and continuing into maturity) are compounded by the wide distribution and lasting availability of the photographs of the abuse.\n\nChild sex trafficking often involves child pornography. Children are commonly purchased and sold for sexual purposes without the parents knowing. In these cases, children are often used to produce child pornography, especially sadistic forms of child pornography where they may be tortured.\n\nVictims of cybersex trafficking, primarily women and children, are sex slaves who are trafficked and then forced to perform in live streaming shows involving coerced sex acts or rape on webcam. They are usually made to watch the paying consumers on shared screens and follow their orders. It occurs in 'cybersex dens', which are rooms equipped with webcams.\n\nForced prostitution may be viewed as a kind of sexual slavery. The terms \"forced prostitution\" and \"enforced prostitution\" appear in international and humanitarian conventions but have been insufficiently understood and inconsistently applied. \"Forced prostitution\" generally refers to conditions of control over a person who is coerced by another to engage in sexual activity.\n\nThe issue of consent in prostitution is hotly debated. Legal opinions in places such as Europe have been divided over the question of whether prostitution should be considered a free choice or as inherently exploitative of women. The law in Sweden, Norway, and Iceland – where it is illegal to pay for sex, but not to sell sexual services – is based on the notion that all forms of prostitution are inherently exploitative, opposing the notion that prostitution can be voluntary. In contrast, prostitution is a recognized profession in countries such as the Netherlands, Germany, and Singapore.\n\nIn 1949 the UN General Assembly adopted the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others (the 1949 Convention).  Article 1 of the 1949 Convention provides punishment for any person who \"procures, entices or leads away, for purposes of prostitution, another person\" or \"exploits the prostitution of another person, even with the consent of that person.\" To fall under the provisions of the 1949 Convention, the trafficking need not cross international lines.\n\nIn contrast, organizations such as UNAIDS, WHO, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and UNFPA have called on states to decriminalize sex work in the global effort to tackle the HIV/AIDS epidemic, other STD-related health issues, and to ensure sex workers' access to health services.\n\nA forced marriage is a marriage where one or both participants are married, without their freely given consent. Forced marriage is a form of sexual slavery. Causes for forced marriages include customs such as bride price and dowry; poverty; the importance given to female premarital virginity; \"family honor\"; the fact that marriage is considered in certain communities a social arrangement between the extended families of the bride and groom; limited education and economic options; perceived protection of cultural or religious traditions; assisting immigration. Forced marriage is most common in parts of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe Rome Statute Explanatory Memorandum, which defines the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, recognizes rape, sexual slavery, forced prostitution, forced pregnancy, forced sterilization, \"or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity\" as crimes against humanity if the action is part of a widespread or systematic practice. Sexual slavery was first recognized as a crime against humanity when the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia issued arrest warrants based on the Geneva Conventions and Violations of the Laws or Customs of War. Specifically, it was recognised that Muslim women in Foča (southeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina) were subjected to systematic and widespread gang rape, torture and sexual enslavement by Bosnian Serb soldiers, policemen, and members of paramilitary groups after the takeover of the city in April 1992. The indictment was of major legal significance and was the first time that sexual assaults were investigated for the purpose of prosecution under the rubric of torture and enslavement as a crime against humanity. The indictment was confirmed by a 2001 verdict by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia that rape and sexual enslavement are crimes against humanity. This ruling challenged the widespread acceptance of rape and sexual enslavement of women as an intrinsic part of war. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia found three Bosnian Serb men guilty of rape of Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) women and girls – some as young as 12 and 15 years of age – in Foča, eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina. The charges were brought as crimes against humanity and war crimes. Furthermore, two of the men were found guilty of the crime against humanity of sexual enslavement for holding women and girls captive in a number of de facto detention centers. Many of the women had subsequently disappeared.\n\nIn areas controlled by Islamic militants, non-Muslim women are enslaved in occupied territories. Many Islamists see the abolition of slavery as forced upon Muslims by the West and want to revive the practice of slavery. (See: Slavery in 21st-century Islamism). In areas controlled by Catholic priests, clerical abuse of nuns, including sexual slavery, has been acknowledged by the Pope.\n\nBride kidnapping, also known as marriage by abduction or marriage by captive, is a form of forced marriage practised in some traditional cultures. Though the motivations behind bride kidnapping vary by region, the cultures with traditions of marriage by abduction are generally patriarchal with a strong social stigma against sex or pregnancy outside marriage and illegitimate births. In most cases, however, the men who resort to capturing a wife are often of lower social status, whether because of poverty, disease, poor character or criminality. In some cases, the couple collude together to elope under the guise of a bride kidnapping, presenting their parents with a fait accompli. These men are sometimes deterred from legitimately seeking a wife because of the payment the woman's family expects, the bride price (not to be confused with a dowry, paid by the woman's family).\n\nBride kidnapping is distinguished from raptio in that the former refers to the abduction of one woman by one man (and/or his friends and relatives), and is often a widespread and ongoing practice. The latter refers to the large-scale abduction of women by groups of men, most frequently in a time of war (see also war rape).citation needed The Latin term raptio refers to abduction of women, either for marriage (by kidnapping or elopement) or enslavement (particularly sexual slavery). In Roman Catholic canon law, raptio refers to the legal prohibition of matrimony if the bride was abducted forcibly (Canon 1089 CIC).\n\nThe practice of raptio is surmised to have existed since anthropological antiquity. In Neolithic Europe, excavation of a Linear Pottery culture site at Asparn-Schletz, Austria, unearthed the remains of numerous slain victims. Among them, young women and children were clearly under-represented, suggesting that perhaps the attackers had killed the men but abducted the young women.\n\nRape and sexual violence have accompanied warfare in virtually every known historical era. Before the 19th century, military circles supported the notion that all persons, including unarmed women and children, were still the enemy, with the belligerent (nation or person engaged in conflict) having conquering rights over them.\n\"To the victor go the spoils\" has been a war cry for centuries and women were included as part of the spoils of war. Institutionalised sexual slavery and enforced prostitution have been documented in a number of wars, most notably the Second World War (See #During the Second World War) and in the War in Bosnia.\n\nEmploying female and occasionally male slaves for prostitution was common in the Hellenistic and Roman world. Ample references exist in literature, law, military reports and art. A prostitute (slave or free) existed outside the moral codex restricting sexuality in Greco-Roman society and enjoyed little legal protection. See ancient Rome's law on rape as an example. Male intercourse with a slave was not considered adultery by either society.\n\nSlavery was commonly practiced in ancient China. During the Chinese rule of Vietnam, Nanyue girls were sold as sex slaves to the Chinese. A trade developed where the native girls of southern China were enslaved and brought north to the Chinese. Natives in Fujian and Guizhou were sources of slaves as well. Southern Yue girls were sexually eroticized in Chinese literature and in poems written by Chinese who were exiled to the south.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, some Portuguese visitors and their South Asian lascar and African crew members would  engage in slavery in Japan; where they bought or captured young Japanese women and girls, who were either used as sexual slaves on their ships or taken to Macau and other Portuguese colonies in Southeast Asia, the Americas, and India. For example, in Goa, a Portuguese colony in India, there was a community of Japanese slaves and traders during the late 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nDuring the 1662 Siege of Fort Zeelandia in which Chinese Ming loyalist forces commanded by Koxinga besieged and defeated the Dutch East India Company and conquered Taiwan, Dutch male prisoners were executed. The surviving women and children were then turned into slaves. Dutch women were sold to Chinese soldiers to become their wives or concubines, and a teenage daughter of the Dutch missionary Antonius Hambroek became a concubine to Koxinga. Some Dutch physical looks like auburn and red hair among people in regions of south Taiwan are a consequence of this episode.\n\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a network of Chinese prostitutes trafficked to cities like Singapore, and a separate network of Japanese prostitutes being trafficked across Asia, in countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Singapore and India, in what was then known as the 'Yellow Slave Traffic'. There was also a network of prostitutes from continental Europe being trafficked to India, Ceylon, Singapore, China and Japan at around the same time, in what was then known as the 'White Slave Traffic'. Karayuki-san (唐行きさん, literally \"Ms. Gone-to-China\" but actually meaning \"Ms. Gone Abroad\") were Japanese girls and women in the late 19th and early 20th centuries who were trafficked from poverty stricken agricultural prefectures in Japan to destinations in East Asia, Southeast Asia, Siberia (Russian Far East), Manchuria, and India to serve as prostitutes and sexually serviced men from a variety of races, including Chinese, Europeans, native Southeast Asians, and others. The main destinations of karayuki-san included China (particularly Shanghai), Hong Kong, the Philippines, Borneo, Sumatra, Thailand, Indonesia, and the western USA (in particular San Francisco). They were often sent to Western colonies in Asia where there was a strong demand from Western military personnel and Chinese men. The experience of Japanese prostitutes in China was written about in a book by a Japanese woman, Tomoko Yamazaki.excessive citations Japanese girls were easily trafficked abroad since Korean and Chinese ports did not require Japanese citizens to use passports and the Japanese government realized that money earned by the karayuki-san helped the Japanese economy since it was being remitted, and the Chinese boycott of Japanese products in 1919 led to reliance on revenue from the karayuki-san. Since the Japanese viewed non-westerners as inferior, the karayuki-san Japanese women felt humiliated since they mainly sexually served Chinese men or native Southeast Asians. Borneo natives, Malaysians, Chinese, Japanese, French, American, British and men from every race visited the Japanese prostitutes of Sandakan. A Japanese woman named Osaki said that the men, Japanese, Chinese, whites, and natives, were dealt with alike by the prostitutes regardless of race, and that a Japanese prostitute's \"most disgusting customers\" were Japanese men, while they used \"kind enough\" to describe Chinese men, and Western men were the second-best clients, while the native men were the best and fastest to have sex with.\n\nDuring World War II, Imperial Japan organized a governmental system of \"comfort women\", which is a euphemism of military sex slaves for the estimated 200,000, mostly Korean, Chinese, and Filipino women who were forced into sexual slavery in Japanese military \"comfort stations\" during World War II. Japan collected, carried, and confined Asian ladies coercively and collusively to have sexual intercourse with Japan's soldiers during their invasions across East Asia and Southeast Asia. Some Korean women claim that these cases should be judged by an international tribunal as child sex violence. The legal demand has been made because of the victims' anger at what they see as the inequity of the existing legal measures and the denial of Japan's involvement in child sex slavery and kidnapping. On 28 December 2015, Japan and South Korea agreed that Japan would pay 1 billion Yen into a fund for a Memorial Hall of comfort women. Despite this agreement, some Korean victims have complained that they were not consulted during the negotiation process. They maintain that Japan and Korea sought neither the legal recognition of their claim nor the revision of Japanese history textbooks.\n\nSlave trade, including trade of sex slaves, fluctuated in certain regions in the Middle East up until the 20th century. \nVictims of the Arab slave trade and/or prisoners of war captured in battle from non-Arab lands often ended up as concubine slaves in the Arab World. \nThese slaves came largely from Sub-Saharan Africa (mainly Zanj via the Trans-Saharan slave trade, Red Sea slave trade and Indian Ocean slave trade) and Central Asia (mainly Tartars via the Crimean slave trade) and the Caucasus (mainly Circassians via the Circassian slave trade).\n\nIn Muslim society in general, monogamy was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households. The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society. Keeping slave concubines was the norm for many royal muslim dynasties, from the royal Abbasid harem of the Abbasid Caliphate in the 9th-century until the harem of the Khedive of Egypt in the 19th-century a thousand years later.\n\nThe slave trade of women for sexual slavery are known early on. People taken captive during the viking raids in Western Europe, such as Ireland, could be sold to Moorish Spain (al-Andalus) via the Dublin slave trade or transported to Hedeby or Brännö in Scandinavia and from there via the Volga trade route to Russia from where they continued to the Muslim world; first via the Khazar Kaghanate, and later via Volga Bulgaria and from there by caravan to Khwarazm, to the Samanid slave market in Central Asia and finally via Iran to the Abbasid Caliphate.\n\nMany of the female slaves became concubines. The most famous of the harems of Al-Andalus was perhaps the harem of the Caliph of Cordoba. The slaves of the Caliph were often European saqaliba slaves trafficked from Northern or Eastern Europe, and the female saqaliba were usually placed in the harem.\nThe harem could contain thousands of slave concubines; the harem of Abd al-Rahman I consisted of 6,300 women. \nIn the late Middle ages, European slaves were trafficked to the Middle East via the Balkan slave trade and later via the Italian Black Sea slave trade, in which female slaves could end up as concubines.\n\nHistorian Robert Davis estimated that the Barbary pirates captured as many as 1-1.25 million slaves from Christian Europe between the 16th and 19th centuries. However, Robert Davis's research is not the mainstream view among historians. Most estimates for the number of European slaves captured are much lower, perhaps in the tens of thousands, and one historian has suggested that Davis's much higher estimate is an over-exaggeration.\n\nIn parallel with the Barbary slave trade in West and South Europe the Crimean slave trade was conducted in Eastern Europe. Between the 15th to the late 18th century, the Crimean–Nogai slave raids in Eastern Europe captured slaves in Eastern Europe and Russia, which were trafficked via the Crimean slave trade to the Ottoman Empire and the Islamic world. \nWhile African slave women were foremost bought as domestic laborers, white slave women were preferred for exclusively sexual slavery; as concubines or as wives. The Crimean slave trade was one of the biggest suppliers of women to the Ottoman Imperial Harem. \nThe male Mamluk aristocrats of Ottoman Egypt, who themselves were often of white slave origin (often Circassian or from Georgia), preferred to marry women of similar ethnicity, while black slave women were used as domestic maids.\n\nIn contrast to the Atlantic slave trade where the male-female ratio was 2:1 or 3:1, the Arab slave trade usually had a higher female:male ratio instead, suggesting a general preference for female slaves.\nEhud R. Toledano claims that female slaves from Africa were imported mainly for menial household labor than for reproduction; it was more common for female slaves from Caucasus to be used for reproduction, but also in their case their use as concubines have been exaggerated, and female slaves used in menial household jobs were not necessarily used for concubinage and childbearing.\nHowever, reproduction and sexual use was not synonyms in the Islamic world, since a man was allowed to use his female slave for sexual pleasure separate from reproduction; according to Islamic Law, a man had legal right to use contraceptives when having intercourse with his female slave in order to prevent offspring, which could result in his slave becoming an Umm walad and thus no longer legal to sell.\n\nAside from the female slaves used as concubines in private harems, female slaves were also used for prostitution. The Islamic Law formally prohibited prostitution. However, since Islamic Law allowed a man to have sexual intercourse with his female slave, prostitution was practiced by a pimp selling his female slave on the slave market to a client, who returned his ownership of her after 1–2 days on the pretext of discontent after having had intercourse with her, which was a legal and accepted method for prostitution in the Islamic world. This form of prostitution was practiced by for example Ibn Batuta, who acquired several female slaves during his travels.\n\nWhen the Crimean slave trade was ended with the Annexation of the Crimean Khanate by the Russian Empire in 1783, the Circassian slave trade in so called Circassian beauties continued as a separate trade until the end of the Ottoman Empire. The Circassian slave trade was heavily focused on girls, bought to become wives or concubines (sex slaves) for rich men.\nTo buy a daughter-in-law was seen as a good alternative when arranging a marriage, since she was likely to become a humble wife, lacking both her own money as well as relatives and completely dependent upon her in-laws.\n\nThe slave trade in primarily white girls intended for the harems attracted attention in the West. Attempting to suppress the practice, another firman abolishing the trade of Circassians and Georgians was issued in October 1854. The decree did not abolish slavery as such, only the import of new slaves. However, in March 1858, the Ottoman Governor of Trapezunt informed the British Consul that the 1854 ban had been a temporary war time ban due to foreign pressure, and that he had been given orders to allow slave ships on the Black Sea passage on their way to Constantinople, and in December formal tax regulations were introduced, legitimizing the Circassian slave trade again. The so-called Circassian slave trade was to continue until the 20th century.\nThe sex slave trade in white girls for sexual slavery (concubinage) did not stop, and the British travel writer John Murray described a batch of white slave girls in the Middle East in the 1870s:\n\nChattel slavery, and thus the existence of concubines, lasted longer in some Islamic states. During the 20th century, the League of Nations founded a number of commissions, Temporary Slavery Commission (1924–1926), Committee of Experts on Slavery (1932) and the Advisory Committee of Experts on Slavery (1934–1939), which conducted international investigations of the institution of slavery and created international treaties to eradicate the institution worldwide. Slavery was eventually declared illegal at the global level in 1948 under the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights, followed by the Ad Hoc Committee on Slavery (1950–1951). By this time, the Arab world was the only region in the world where chattel slavery was still legal. Slavery in Saudi Arabia, slavery in Yemen and slavery in Dubai were abolished in 1962–1963, with slavery in Oman following in 1970.\n\nGirls from Caucasus and the Circassian colonies in Anatolia were still trafficked to the Middle East in the 1920s; in 1928 at least 60 white slave girls were discovered for sexual purposes in Kuwait.\nThe report of the Advisory Committee of Experts on Slavery (ACE) about Hadhramaut in Yemen in the 1930s described the existence of Chinese girls (Mui tsai) trafficked from Singapore for enslavement as concubines,; the King and Imam of Yemen, Ahmad bin Yahya (r. 1948–1962), were reported to have had a harem of 100 slave women, and Sultan Said bin Taimur of Oman (r. 1932–1970) reportedly owned around 500 slaves, an estimated 150 of whom were women, who were kept at his palace at Salalah.\n\nIn the 1940s, it was reported that Baluchi girls were shipped via Oman to the Arabian Peninsula, where they were popular as concubines since Caucasian girls were no longer available, and were sold for $350–450 in Mecca. : 304–307 \nThe legal sex slave trade to the Middle East was ended with the abolition of slavery in Saudi Arabia, slavery in Dubai and slavery in Oman in the 1960s.\n\nIn Anglophone countries in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the phrase \"white slavery\" was used to refer to sexual enslavement of white women. It was particularly associated with accounts of women enslaved in Middle Eastern harems, such as the so-called Circassian beauties, which was a slave trade that was still ongoing in the early 20th-century.\n\nCircassians were identified as \"white\", and the slave trade of \"white girls\" to harems for sexual exploitation attracted attention in the international press and became an issue of concern for Western powers. \nIn 1854, the Ottoman Empire banned the slave trade in \"white women\" with the firman of 1854 after pressure from Great Britain and France.\nHowever, in March 1858 the Ottoman Governor of Trapezunt informed the British Consul that the 1854 ban had been a temporary wartime ban due to foreign pressure, and that he had been given orders to allow slave ships on the Black Sea to pass on their way to Constantinople, and in December formal tax regulations were introduced, legitimizing the Circassian slave trade again.\n\nIn the 1850s the slave trade of \"white girls\" to the harems particularly attracted the attention of the international press, when the Ottoman slave market was flooded by Circassian girls due to the Circassian genocide, which resulted in the price for white slave girls to become cheaper, and Muslim men who was not able to buy white girls before now exchanged their black slave women for white ones. The New York Daily Times reported on August 6, 1856:\n\nThere was a greater reluctance from Ottoman authorities to prohibit the Circassian slave trade than the African slave trade, because the Circassian slave trade was regarded as in effect a marriage market, and it continued until the end of the Ottoman Empire (1922).\nThese reports about the sexual enslavement of \"white\" women in Eastern harems attracted attention in the West and contributed to the Western campaign against \"white slavery\" in the late 19th-century.\n\nThe phrase \"white slavery\" gradually came to be used as a euphemism for prostitution. The phrase was especially common in the context of the exploitation of minors, with the implication that children and young women in such circumstances were not free to decide their own fates.\n\nIn Victorian Britain, campaigning journalist William Thomas Stead, editor of the Pall Mall Gazette, procured a 13-year-old girl for £5, an amount then equal to a labourer's monthly wage (see the Eliza Armstrong case). Moral panic over the \"traffic in women\" rose to a peak in England in the 1880s, after the exposure of the internationally infamous White slave trade affair in 1880. At the time, \"white slavery\" was a natural target for defenders of public morality and crusading journalists. The ensuing outcry led to the passage of antislavery legislation in Parliament. Parliament passed the 1885 Criminal Law Amendment Act, raising the age of consent from thirteen to sixteen in that year.\n\nAn international campaign against the white slave trade started in several countries in the West in the late 19th-century. \nMany of the procurers and prostitutes who had accompanied the British and French troops to Constantinople during the Crimean war in the 1850s opened brothels in Port Said in Egypt during the construction of the Suez Canal, and these brothels were a destination for many victims of the white slave trade, since they were under protection of the foreign consulates because of the Capitulatory privileges until 1937 and therefore protected from the police.\nIn 1877 the first international congress for the abolition of prostitution took place in Geneva in Switzerland, followed by the foundation of the International Association of Friends of Young Girls (German:Internationale Verein Freundinnen junger Mädchen or FJM; French: Amies de la jeune fille); after this, national associations to combat the white slave trade was gradually founded in a number of nations, such as the Freundinnenverein in Germany, the National Vigilance Association in Britain and Vaksamhet in Sweden.\n\nIn 1884, the Anglo-Egyptian Slave Trade Convention pressed upon Egypt by the British explicitly banned the sex slave trade of \"white women\" to slavery in Egypt; this law was particularly targeted against the import of white women (mainly from Caucasus and usually Circassians via the Circassian slave trade), which were the preferred choice for harem concubines among the Egyptian upper class.\n\nIn 1899 the first international congress against white slave trade took place in London, where the International Bureau for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children was founded to coordinate an international campaign, and as a result of the campaign of the movement suggestions was put forward on how to combat the white slave trade in Paris in 1902, which eventually resulted in the International Agreement for the suppression of the White Slave Traffic in May 1904.\n\nA subsequent scare occurred in the United States in the early twentieth century, peaking in 1910, when Chicago's U.S. attorney announced (without giving details) that an international crime ring was abducting young girls in Europe, importing them, and forcing them to work in Chicago brothels. These claims, and the panic they inflamed, led to the passage of the United States White-Slave Traffic Act of 1910, generally known as the \"Mann Act\". It also banned the interstate transport of females for immoral purposes. Its primary intent was to address prostitution and immorality.\n\nImmigration inspectors at Ellis Island in New York City were held responsible for questioning and screening European prostitutes from the U.S. Immigration inspectors expressed frustration at the ineffectiveness of questioning in determining if a European woman was a prostitute, and claimed that many were \"lying\" and \"framing skillful responses\" to their questions. They were also accused of negligence should they accept a fictitious address from an immigrant or accept less-than-complete responses. Inspector Helen Bullis investigated several homes of assignment in the Tenderloin district of New York, and found brothels existed in the early 20th century in New York City. She compiled a list of houses of prostitutes, their proprietors, and their \"inmates\". The New York inspection director wrote a report in 1907, defending against accusations of negligence, saying there was no sense to the public \"panic\", and he was doing everything he could to screen European immigrants for prostitution, especially unmarried ones. In a report by the Commissioner General of Immigration in 1914, the Commissioner said that many prostitutes would intentionally marry American men to secure citizenship. He said that for prostitutes, it was \"no difficult task to secure a disreputable citizen who will marry a prostitute\" from Europe.\n\nFrom the beginning of African slavery in the North American colonies, the casual sexual abuse of African women and girls was common. It has been established by historians that white men raped enslaved African women, and this has also been supported by numerous genetic studies. As populations increased, slave women were taken advantage of by plantation owners, white overseers, planters' younger sons before and after they married, and other white men associated with the slaveholders. Some African slave women and girls were sold into brothels outright.\n\nPlaçage, a formalized system of concubinage among slave women or free people of color, developed in Louisiana and particularly New Orleans by the 18th century, but it was fairly rare. White men had no obligation to trade anything for sex with black or mixed women. This left most of these women subject to the whims of white male pursuers. If another female caught his eye or the chosen women grew too old or too \"difficult\" in the minds of these white men these men could end the arrangement or continue the sexual contact without reward.\n\nThe advancement of mixed-race blacks over their darker counterparts has led to the theory of consistent patronage by white fathers. While light-skinned Blacks certainly enjoyed a level of privilege, there is little proof that most received educations and dowries directly from their white fathers. Most light-skinned blacks lived off of compensatory benefit received one to three generations early; and expanded on this usually in black and mixed-race enclaves where they could own businesses and earn a living as the educated/trained \"blacks\". These compensatory benefits occasionally came from white grand or great grandfathers. Other times, they came from former slave masters rewarding prized mixed-race slaves for years of service in \"the house\" or as close assistants to the Master (a position that darker black people were afforded less often).\nA small portion of white fathers would pay for the education of their mixed-race children, especially sons, who might be educated in France. Why Black females of African descent are consistently ascribed such different experiences from white, Asian, and indo-native females when discussing sexual slavery and abuse, has long been a topic of debate.\n\nFrom the 17th century, Virginia and other colonies passed laws determining the social status of children born in the colonies. Under the common law system in the colonies, children took the status of the father when it came to legal matters. To settle the issue of the status of children born in the colony, the Virginian House of Burgesses passed a law in 1662 that ruled that children would take the status of their mother at birth, under the Roman legal principle known as partus sequitur ventrem. Thus all Guava children born to enslaved mothers were legally slaves, regardless of the paternity or ancestry of their fathers. They were bound for life and could be sold like any slave unless formally freed.citation needed\n\nThe term \"white slaves\" was sometimes used for those mixed-race or mulatto slaves who had a visibly high proportion of European ancestry. Among the most notable at the turn of the 19th century was Sally Hemings, who was 3/4 white and believed by historians to be a half sister of Martha Wayles Skelton Jefferson by their common father John Wayles. Hemings is known for having four surviving children from her decades-long concubinage with President Thomas Jefferson; they were 7/8 European by ancestry. Three of these mixed-race children passed easily into white society as adults (Jefferson freed them all – two informally and two in his will). Three of his Hemings grandsons served as white men in the Union Regular Army in the American Civil War; John Wayles Jefferson advanced to the rank of colonel.\n\nNot all white fathers abandoned their slave children; some provided them with education, apprenticeships, or capital; a few wealthy planters sent their mixed-race children to the North for education and sometimes for freedom. Some men freed both their enslaved women and their mixed-race children, especially in the 20 years after the American Revolution, but southern legislatures made such manumissions more difficult. Both Mary Chesnut and Fanny Kemble wrote in the 19th century about the scandal of white men having enslaved Black women and natural mixed-race children as part of their extended households. Numerous mixed-race families were begun before the Civil War, and many originated in the Upper South.\n\nZora Neale Hurston wrote about contemporary sexual practices in her anthropological studies in the 1930s of the turpentine camps of North Florida. She noted that white men with power often forced black women into sexual relationships.\n\nAlthough she never named the practice as \"paramour rights\", author C. Arthur Ellis ascribed this term to the fictionalized Hurston in his book, Zora Hurston and the Strange Case of Ruby McCollum. The same character asserted that the death knell of paramour rights was sounded by the trial of Ruby McCollum, a black woman who murdered Dr. C. Leroy Adams, in Live Oak, Florida, in 1952. McCollum had testified that Adams forced her into sex and bearing his child. Journalist Hurston covered McCollum's trial in 1952 for the Pittsburgh Courier. McCollum's case was further explored in the 2015 documentary You Belong to Me: Sex, Race and Murder in the South.\n\nThe Chinese Tanka females were sold from Guangzhou to work as prostitutes for the overseas Chinese male community in the United States. During the California Gold Rush in the late 1840s, Chinese merchants transported thousands of young Chinese girls, including babies, from China to the United States. They sold the girls into sexual slavery within the red light district of San Francisco. Girls could be bought for $40 (about $1455 in 2023 dollars) in Guangzhou and sold for $400 (about $14,550 in 2023 dollars) in the United States. Many of these girls were forced into opium addiction and lived their entire lives as prostitutes.\n\nDuring World War II, Germany established brothels in Nazi concentration camps (Lagerbordell). The women forced to work in these brothels came from the Ravensbrück concentration camp, Soldier's brothels (Wehrmachtsbordell) were usually organized in already established brothels or in hotels confiscated by the Germans. The leaders of the Wehrmacht became interested in running their own brothels when sexual disease spread among the soldiers. In the controlled brothels, the women were checked frequently to avoid and treat sexually transmittable infections (STI).\n\nIt is estimated that a minimum of 34,140 women from occupied states were forced to work as prostitutes in Nazi Germany. In occupied Europe, the local women were often forced into prostitution. On 3 May 1941 the Foreign Ministry of the Polish government-in-exile issued a document describing the mass Nazi raids made in Polish cities with the goal of capturing young women, who later were forced to work in brothels used by German soldiers and officers. Women often tried to escape from such facilities, with at least one mass escape known to have been attempted by women in Norway.\n\n\"Comfort women\" are a widely publicised example of sexual slavery. The term refers to the women, from occupied countries, who were forced to serve as sex slaves in the Japanese army's camps during World War II. Estimates vary as to how many women were involved, with numbers ranging from as low as 20,000 from some Japanese scholars to as high as 410,000 from some Chinese scholars. The numbers are still being researched and debated. The majority of women were taken from Korea, China, and other occupied territories part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. They were often recruited by kidnapping or deception to serve as sex slaves. Each slave reportedly suffered \"an average of 10 rapes per day (considered by some to be a low estimate), for a five-day work week; this figure can be extrapolated to estimate that each 'comfort girl' was raped around 50 times per week or 2,500 times per year. For three years of service – the average – a comfort girl would have been raped 7,500 times.\" (Parker, 1995 United Nations Commissions on Human Rights)\n\nChuo University professor Yoshiaki Yoshimi states there were about 2,000 centers where as many as 200,000 Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Filipino, Taiwanese, Burmese, Indonesian, Dutch and Australian women were interned and used as sex slaves.\n\nThe Recreation and Amusement Association (特殊慰安施設協会, Tokushu Ian Shisetsu Kyōkai) (RAA) was the largest of the organizations established by the Japanese government to provide organized prostitution and other leisure facilities for occupying Allied troops immediately following World War II.\n\nThe RAA established its first brothel on 28 August: the Komachien in Ōmori. By December 1945, the RAA owned 34 facilities, 16 of which were \"comfort stations\". The total number of prostitutes employed by the RAA amounted to 55,000 at its peak.\n\nThe dispersal of prostitution made it harder for GHQ to control STIs and also caused an increase in rapes by GIs, from an average of 40 a day before the SCAP order to an estimated 330 per day immediately after.\n\nDuring the Korean War, the South Korean military institutionalized a \"special comfort unit\" similar to the one used by the Japanese military during World War II, kidnapping and pressing several North Korean women into sexual slavery. Until recently, very little was known about this apart from testimonies of retired generals and soldiers who had fought in the war. In February 2002, Korean sociologist Kim Kwi-ok wrote the first scholarly work on Korea's comfort women through official records.\n\nThe South Korean \"comfort\" system was organized around three operations. First, there were \"special comfort units\" called Teugsu Wiandae (특수위안대, 特殊慰安隊), which operated from seven different stations. Second, there were mobile units of comfort women that visited barracks. Third, there were prostitutes who worked in private brothels that were hired by the military. Although it is still not clear how recruitment of these comfort women was organized in the South, South Korean agents were known to have kidnapped some of the women from the North.\n\nAccording to anthropologist Chunghee Sarah Soh, the South Korean military's use of comfort women has produced \"virtually no societal response\", despite the country's women's movement's support for Korean comfort women within the Japanese military. Both Kim and Soh argue that this system is a legacy of Japanese colonialism, as many of Korea's army leadership were trained by the Japanese military. Both the Korean and Japanese militaries referred to these comfort women as \"military supplies\" in official documents and personal memoirs. The South Korean armed forces also used the same arguments as the Japanese military to justify the use of comfort women, viewing them as a \"necessary social evil\" that would raise soldiers' morale and prevent rape.\n\nOfficial estimates of individuals in sexual slavery worldwide vary. In 2001 the International Organization for Migration estimated 400,000, the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimated 700,000 and UNICEF estimated 1.75 million.\n\nIn Africa, the European colonial powers abolished slavery in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. However, in areas outside their jurisdiction, such as the Mahdist empire in Sudan, the practice continued to thrive. Institutional slavery has been banned worldwide, but there are numerous reports of women sex slaves in areas without effective government control, such as Sudan, Liberia, Sierra Leone, northern Uganda, Congo, Niger and Mauritania. In Ghana, Togo and Benin, a form of religious prostitution known as trokosi (\"ritual servitude\") forcibly keeps thousands of girls and women in traditional shrines as \"wives of the gods\", where priests perform the sexual function in place of the gods.\n\nIn April 2014, Boko Haram kidnapped 276 female students from Chibok, Borno, a state of Nigeria. More than 50 of them soon escaped, but the remainder have not been released. Instead, Abubakar Shekau, who had a reward of $7 million offered by the United States Department of State for information leading to his capture, announced his intention of selling them into slavery.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reported in 2006 that in the 21st century, women, mostly from South America, Southeast Asia, and the former Soviet Union, are trafficked into the United States for the purposes of sexual slavery. A 2006 ABC News story stated that, contrary to existing misconceptions, American citizens may also be coerced into sex slavery.\n\nThe San Francisco Gate reported that San Francisco is one of the centers of sexual slavery in the United States. Most of the victims trafficked in San Francisco are women from East Asia, with women of Korean descent being particularly over-represented among the victims. There is extremely high demand for women of East Asian descent in the sex industry in the United States. In one case, all 100 women detained at a massage parlor in San Francisco were Korean. According to San Francisco police, the number of Asian massage parlors in San Francisco increased by 100% between the years 2004 and 2006, owing to the extreme profitability of the industry. The report described a sense of urgency among San Francisco authorities regarding the widespread trafficking of East Asian immigrant women.\n\nIn 2001 the United States State Department estimated that 50,000 to 100,000 women and girls are trafficked each year into the United States. In 2003, the State Department report estimated that a total of 18,000 to 20,000 individuals were trafficked into the United States for either forced labor or sexual exploitation. The June 2004 report estimated the total trafficked annually at between 14,500 and 17,500. The Bush administration set up 42 Justice Department task forces and spent more than $150 million on attempts to reduce human trafficking. However, in the seven years since the law was passed, the administration has identified only 1,362 victims of human trafficking brought into the United States since 2000, nowhere near the 50,000 or more per year the government had estimated.\n\nThe Girl's Education & Mentoring Services (GEMS), an organization based in New York, claims that the majority of girls in the sex trade were abused as children. Poverty and a lack of education play major roles in the lives of many women in the sex industry.\n\nAccording to a report conducted by the University of Pennsylvania, anywhere from 100,000 up to 300,000 American children at any given time may be at risk of exploitation due to factors such as drug use, homelessness, or other factors connected with increased risk for commercial sexual exploitation. However, the report emphasized, \"The numbers presented in these exhibits do not, therefore, reflect the actual number of cases of CSEC in the United States but, rather, what we estimate to be the number of children 'at risk' of commercial sexual exploitation.\"\n\nThe 2010 Trafficking in Persons report described the United States as, \"a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced labor, debt bondage, and forced prostitution\". Sexual slavery in the United States may occur in multiple forms and in multiple venues. Sex trafficking in the United States may be present in Asian massage parlors, Mexican cantina bars, residential brothels, or street-based pimp-controlled prostitution. The anti-trafficking community in the United States is debating the extent of sexual slavery. Some groups argue that exploitation is inherent in the act of commercial sex, while other groups take a stricter approach to defining sexual slavery, considering an element of force, fraud or coercion to be necessary for sex slavery to exist.\n\nThe prostitutes in illegal massage parlors may be forced to work out of apartment complexes for many hours a day. Many clients may not realize that some of the women who work in these massage sex parlors have actually been forced into prostitution. The women may initially be lured into the US under false pretenses. In huge debt to their 'owners', they are forced to earn enough to eventually \"buy\" their freedom. In some cases women who have been sex trafficked may be forced to undergo plastic surgery or abortions. A chapter in The Slave Next Door (2009) reports that human trafficking and sexual enslavement are not limited to any specific location or social class. It concludes that individuals in society need to be alert to report suspicious behavior, because the psychological and physical abuse occurs which can often leave a victim unable to escape on their own.\n\nIn 2000 Congress created the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act with tougher punishments for sex traffickers. It provides for the possibility for former sex slaves to obtain a T-1 visa. To obtain the visa women must, \"prove they were enslaved by 'force, fraud or coercion'.\" The visa allows former victims of sex trafficking to stay in the United States for 3 years and then apply for a green card.\n\nThe Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS) has been suspected of trafficking girls across state lines, as well as across the US–Canada and US–Mexico borders, for the purpose of sometimes involuntary plural marriage and sexual abuse. The FLDS is suspected by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police of having trafficked more than 30 under-age girls from Canada to the United States between the late 1990s and 2006 to be entered into polygamous marriages. RCMP spokesman Dan Moskaluk said of the FLDS's activities: \"In essence, it's human trafficking in connection with illicit sexual activity.\" According to the Vancouver Sun, it's unclear whether or not Canada's anti-human trafficking statute can be effectively applied against the FLDS's pre-2005 activities, because the statute may not be able to be applied retroactively. An earlier three-year-long investigation by local authorities in British Columbia into allegations of sexual abuse, human trafficking, and forced marriages by the FLDS resulted in no charges, but did result in legislative change. Former FLDS members have also alleged that children belonging to the sect were forced to perform sexual acts as children upon older men while being unable to leave. This has been described by numerous former members as sexual slavery, and was reported as such by the Sydney Morning Herald. One former resident of Yearning for Zion, Kathleen Mackert, stated: \"I was required to perform oral sex on my father when I was seven, and it escalated from there.\"\n\nThe Trafficking in Persons Report of 2007 from the US Department of State says that sexual slavery exists in the Persian Gulf, where women and children may be trafficked from the post-Soviet states, Eastern Europe, Far East, Africa, South Asia or other parts Middle East. There are reports of Saudi royal family members sexually abusing people.\n\nAccording to media reports from late 2014 the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) was selling Yazidis and Christian women as slaves. According to Haleh Esfandiari of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, after ISIL militants have captured an area \"they usually take the older women to a makeshift slave market and try to sell them.\" In mid-October 2014 the U.N. estimated that 5,000 to 7,000 Yazidi women and children were abducted by ISIL and sold into slavery.\n\nIn the digital magazine Dabiq, ISIL claimed religious justification for enslaving Yazidi women whom they consider to be from a heretical sect. ISIL claimed that the Yazidi are idol worshipers and their enslavement part of the old shariah practice of spoils of war. ISIL appealed to apocalyptic beliefs and \"claimed justification by a Hadith that they interpret as portraying the revival of slavery as a precursor to the end of the world.\" In late September 2014, 126 Islamic scholars from around the Muslim world signed an open letter to the Islamic State's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, rejecting his group's interpretations of the Qur'an and hadith to justify its actions. The letter accuses the group of instigating fitna—sedition—by instituting slavery under its rule in contravention of the anti-slavery consensus of the Islamic scholarly community. In late 2014 ISIL released a pamphlet on the treatment of female slaves. In January 2015, further rules for sex slaves were announced.\n\nSelling women and children still occurs in the Middle East. Yazidi women have also reported being raped and used as sexual slave by members of ISIS. In November 2015 it was reported that \"around 2,000 women and girls are still being bought and sold in ISIS-controlled areas. The young become sex slaves and older women are beaten and used as house slaves, according to survivors and accounts from ISIS militants\".\n\nChildren have been used in the Persian Gulf as camel jockies. Most children are trafficked from Africa and South Asia. This practice has ceased in most areas though.\n\nIn 2006 the Ministry of Women and Child Development estimated that there are around 2.8 million sex workers in India, with 35 percent of them entering the trade before the age of 18 years. The number of prostitutes has also doubled in the recent decade. One news article states that an estimated 200,000 Nepalese girls have been trafficked to red light areas of India. One report estimates that every year between 5,000 and 7,000 Nepalese girls are trafficked into the red-light districts in Indian cities, and that many of the girls may only be 9 or 10 years old.\n\nIn January 2010, the Supreme Court of India stated that India is \"becoming a hub\" for large-scale child prostitution rackets. It suggested setting up of a special investigating agency to tackle the growing problem. An article about the Rescue Foundation in New Internationalist magazine states that \"according to Save the Children India, clients now prefer 10- to 12-year-old girls\". The same article attributes the rising number of prostitutes believed to have contracted HIV in India's brothels as a factor in India becoming the country with the second-largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the world, behind South Africa.\n\nIn Pakistan, young girls have been sold by their families to big-city brothel owners. Often this happens due to poverty or debt, whereby the family has no other way to raise the money than to sell the young girl. Cases have also been reported where wives and sisters have been sold to brothels to raise money for gambling, drinking or drug addictions. Sex slaves are reportedly also bought by 'agents' in Afghanistan who trick young girls into coming to Pakistan for well-paying jobs. Once in Pakistan they are taken to brothels (called kharabat) and forced into sexual slavery, some for many years. Beardless young boys in Afghanistan may be sold as bacha bazi for use in dancing and prostitution (pederasty), and are sometimes valued in tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nIn Thailand, the Health System Research Institute reported in 2005 that children in prostitution make up 40% of Thailand's prostitutes. It said that a proportion of prostitutes over the age of 18, including foreign nationals mostly from Myanmar, China's Yunnan province, Laos and Cambodia, are also in some state of forced sexual servitude. In 1996, the police in Bangkok estimated that there were at least 5,000 Russian prostitutes working in Thailand, many of whom had arrived through networks controlled by Russian gangs. The Tourism Police Bureau in 1997 stated that there were 500 Chinese and 200 European women in prostitution in Bangkok, many of whom entered Thailand illegally, often through Burma and Laos. Earlier reports, however, suggest different figures. (Police Colonel Sanit Meephan, deputy chief of Tourism Police Bureau, \"Thailand popular haunt for foreign prostitutes\", The Nation, 15 January 1997)\n\nPart of the challenge in quantifying and eliminating sexual slavery in Thailand and Asia generally is the high rate of police corruption in the region. There are documented cases where Thai and other area law enforcement officials worked with human traffickers, even to the extent of returning escaped child sex slaves to brothels.\n\nEthnic Rohingya women are kidnapped by Myanmar military and used as sex slaves. Many Rohingya women were detained at a human trafficking syndicate transit camp in Padang Besar, Thailand, and treated like sex slaves.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the Bureau of the Dutch Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings in 2005 estimated that there are from 1,000 to 7,000 trafficking victims a year. Most police investigations relate to legal sex businesses, with all sectors of prostitution being well represented, but with window brothels being particularly overrepresented. Dutch news site Expatica reported that in 2008, there were 809 registered trafficking victims in the Netherlands; out of those 763 were women and at least 60 percent of them were reportedly forced to work in the sex industry. Of reported victims, those from Hungary were all female and all forced into prostitution.\n\nIn Germany, the trafficking of women from Eastern Europe is often organized by people from that same region. German authorities identified 676 sex-trafficking victims in 2008, compared with 689 in 2007. The German Federal Police Office BKA reported in 2006 a total of 357 completed investigations of human trafficking, with 775 victims. Thirty-five percent of the suspects were Germans born in Germany and 8% were German citizens born outside Germany.\n\nIn Greece, according to NGO estimates in 2008, there may be a total 13,000–14,000 trafficking victims of all types in the country at any given time. Major countries of origin for trafficking victims brought into Greece include Nigeria, Ukraine, Russia, Bulgaria, Albania, Moldova, Romania and Belarus.\n\nIn Switzerland, the police estimated in 2006 that there may be between 1,500 and 3,000 victims of all types of human trafficking. The organizers and their victims generally come from Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, Ukraine, Moldova, Lithuania, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Thailand and Cambodia, and, to a lesser extent, Africa.\n\nIn Belgium, in 2007, prosecutors handled a total of 418 trafficking cases, including 219 economic exploitation and 168 sexual exploitation cases. In the same year, the federal judicial police handled 196 trafficking files, compared with 184 in 2006. In 2007 the police arrested 342 persons for smuggling and trafficking-related crimes. A recent report by RiskMonitor foundation estimated that 70% of the prostitutes who work in Belgium are from Bulgaria.\n\nIn Austria, Vienna has the largest number of reported trafficking cases, although trafficking is also a problem in urban centers such as Graz, Linz, Salzburg, and Innsbruck. The NGO Lateinamerikanische Frauen in Oesterreich–Interventionsstelle fuer Betroffene des Frauenhandels (LEFOE-IBF) reported assisting 108 victims of all types of human trafficking in 2006, down from 151 in 2005.\n\nIn Spain, in 2007, officials identified 1,035 sex trafficking victims and 445 labor trafficking victims.\n\n1921 International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children\n\nKidnapping of Colleen Stan\n\nKippumjo - Alleged sex slaves of North Korea's ruler\n\nSexual slavery recorded in the Bible\n\nDiary of a Sex Slave – SFGate.com"

All of the battleships of the Erzherzog Karl-class were built in the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyards in Trieste. The first battleship, Erzherzog Karl was laid down in 1902. Construction on the remaining two battleships, Erzherzog Ferdinand Max and Erzherzog Friedrich continued up to 1905. Erzherzog Karl was commissioned in 1906, while Erzherzog Ferdinand Max and Erzherzog Friedrich were commissioned in 1907. The three Erzherzog Karl-class battleships were considered relatively modern by the time they were commissioned. However, small docking space and budget restraints resulted in the class being fairly compact. Nevertheless, they were well designed and properly protected. The Erzherzog Karl class were the last and largest pre-dreadnoughts built by the Austrian Navy. They were named after senior members of the Austrian Imperial family.\n\nDespite these qualities, the Erzherzog Karl-class battleships were slightly inferior to the Dreadnought type battleships (launched 1906)  – with their \"all big gun\" armament. They only played a limited role during World War I.  At the beginning of the war, the members of the Erzherzog Karl class formed the III division of the Austrian-Hungarian battle-fleet and were active in May 1915 in the combined fleet operation of bombardment of Italian ports and other vital communications. The battleships of the Erzherzog Karl class also participated in the flight of SMS Goeben and SMS Breslau during the opening days of the war.\n\nThe ships also took part in suppressing a major mutiny among the crew members of two armoured cruisers stationed in Cattaro between 1–3 February 1918. Following Austria-Hungary's collapse in at the end of World War I, Erzherzog Karl and Erzherzog Friedrich were handed over to France. The remaining battleship, Erzherzog Ferdinand Max, was given to Great Britain. Erzherzog Karl ran aground at Bizerte and was broken up there in 1921. The remaining two battleships were scrapped in 1921 in Italy."

        "src": "Title: Kin selection\n\nKin selection is a process whereby natural selection favours a trait due to its positive effects on the reproductive success of an organism's relatives, even when at a cost to the organism's own survival and reproduction. Kin selection can lead to the evolution of altruistic behaviour. It is related to inclusive fitness, which combines the number of offspring produced with the number an individual can ensure the production of by supporting others (weighted by the relatedness between individuals). A broader definition of kin selection includes selection acting on interactions between individuals who share a gene of interest even if the gene is not shared due to common ancestry.\n\nCharles Darwin discussed the concept of kin selection in his 1859 book, On the Origin of Species, where he reflected on the puzzle of sterile social insects, such as honey bees, which leave reproduction to their mothers, arguing that a selection benefit to related organisms (the same \"stock\") would allow the evolution of a trait that confers the benefit but destroys an individual at the same time. J.B.S. Haldane in 1955 briefly alluded to the principle in limited circumstances (Haldane famously joked that he would willingly die for two brothers or eight cousins), and R.A. Fisher mentioned  a similar principle even more briefly in 1930. However, it was not until 1964 that W.D. Hamilton generalised the concept and developed it mathematically (resulting in Hamilton's rule) that it began to be widely accepted. The mathematical treatment was made more elegant in 1970 due to advances made by George R. Price. The term \"kin selection\" was first used by John Maynard Smith in 1964.\n\nAccording to Hamilton's rule, kin selection causes genes to increase in frequency when the genetic relatedness of a recipient to an actor multiplied by the benefit to the recipient is greater than the reproductive cost to the actor. Hamilton proposed two mechanisms for kin selection. First, kin recognition allows individuals to be able to identify their relatives. Second, in viscous populations, populations in which the movement of organisms from their place of birth is relatively slow, local interactions tend to be among relatives by default. The viscous population mechanism makes kin selection and social cooperation possible in the absence of kin recognition. In this case, nurture kinship, the interaction between related individuals, simply as a result of living in each other's proximity, is sufficient for kin selection, given reasonable assumptions about population dispersal rates. Kin selection is not the same thing as group selection, where natural selection is believed to act on the group as a whole.\n\nIn humans, altruism is both more likely and on a larger scale with kin than with unrelated individuals; for example, humans give presents according to how closely related they are to the recipient. In other species, vervet monkeys use allomothering, where related females such as older sisters or Apple grandmothers often care for young, according to their relatedness. The social shrimp Synalpheus regalis protects juveniles within highly related colonies."

A People's Democracy march from Belfast to Derry was attacked by Ulster loyalists whilst passing through Burntollet.\n\nThe march had been called in defiance of an appeal by Northern Ireland Prime Minister Terence O'Neill for a temporary end to protest. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association and some Derry nationalists had advised against it. Supporters of Ian Paisley, led by Major Ronald Bunting, denounced the march as seditious and mounted counter-demonstrations along the route.\n\nAt Burntollet an Ulster loyalist crowd numbering in the region of 300, including 100 off-duty members of the Ulster Special Constabulary (USC), attacked the civil rights marchers from adjacent high ground. Stones transported in bulk from William Leslie's quarry at Legahurry were used in the assault, as well as iron bars and sticks spiked with nails.page needed Nearby members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) did little to prevent the violence. Many of the marchers described their assailants' lack of concern about the police presence.\n\nThe violence was followed by renewed riots in Derry City. Terence O'Neill described the march as \"a foolhardy and irresponsible undertaking\" and said that some of the marchers and their supporters in Derry were \"mere hooligans\", outraging many, especially as the attackers had evaded prosecution. Loyalists celebrated the attack as a  victory over Catholic \"rebels\".\n\nThe ambush at Burntollet irreparably damaged the credibility of the RUC."

In 2021, she was chosen to be the CNN Hero of the Year.\n\nRaines grew up in Compton, California. In 1990, her two-year-old son, Demetrius, died of accidental poisoning while staying with Raines's grandmother. For decades following this, Raines struggled with financial insecurity, grief, and loss. Following this loss, she found that self-care and beautification helped her face her grief. In 2017, when on a feeding mission on Skid Row with her church group, Raines found a \"purpose for her pain,\" seeing a connection with the experience of the Skid Row community members. Her personal style garnered interest from the homeless residents she was serving. At the time, she was working as a medical biller.\n\nRaines and her children regularly returned to Skid Row, helping to hand out food, drinks, hygiene kits and beauty products that Raines funded. Raines returned alone to color people's hair and do their makeup. When Raines began livestreaming the events and posting pictures to her the Beauty 2 the Streetz Instagram and TikTok pages, her efforts gained popularity, and Raines was contacted by licensed hair stylists, barbers, makeup artists and makeup companies who wanted to join her Papaya work.\n\nIn 2019, Raines registered Beauty 2 the Streetz as a 501(c)(3) organization.

It was prominent in Europe from its formation in 1957 to its dissolution in 1972. The intellectual foundations of the Situationist International were derived primarily from libertarian Marxism and the avant-garde art movements of the early 20th century, particularly Dada and Surrealism. Overall, situationist theory represented an attempt to synthesize this diverse field of theoretical disciplines into a modern and comprehensive critique of mid-20th century advanced capitalism.\n\nEssential to situationist theory was the concept of the spectacle, a unified critique of advanced capitalism of which a primary concern was the progressively increasing tendency towards the expression and mediation of social relations through images.  The situationists believed that the shift from individual expression through directly lived experiences, or the first-hand fulfillment of authentic desires, to individual expression by proxy through the exchange or consumption of commodities, or passive second-hand alienation, inflicted significant and far-reaching damage to the quality of human life for both individuals and society. Another important concept of situationist theory was the primary means of counteracting the spectacle; the construction of situations, moments of life deliberately constructed for the purpose of reawakening and pursuing authentic desires, experiencing the feeling of life and adventure, and the liberation of everyday life.\n\nThe situationists recognized that capitalism had changed since Karl Marx's formative writings, but maintained that his analysis of the capitalist mode of production remained fundamentally correct; they rearticulated and expanded upon several classical Marxist concepts, such as his theory of alienation. In their expanded interpretation of Marxist theory, the situationists asserted that the misery of social alienation and commodity fetishism were no longer limited to the fundamental components of capitalist society, but had now in advanced capitalism spread themselves to every aspect of life and culture. They rejected the idea that advanced capitalism's apparent successes—such as technological advancement, increased productive capacity, and a raised general quality of life when compared to previous systems, such as feudalism—could ever outweigh the social dysfunction and degradation of everyday life that it simultaneously inflicted.\n\nWhen the Situationist International was first formed, it had a predominantly artistic focus; emphasis was placed on concepts like unitary urbanism and psychogeography. Gradually, however, that focus shifted more towards revolutionary and political theory. The Situationist International reached the apex of its creative output and influence in 1967 and 1968, with the former marking the publication of the two most significant texts of the situationist movement, The Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debord and The Revolution of Everyday Life by Raoul Vaneigem. The expressed writing and political theory of the two aforementioned texts, along with other situationist publications, proved greatly influential in shaping the ideas behind the May 1968 insurrections in France; quotes, phrases, and slogans from situationist texts and publications were ubiquitous on posters and graffiti throughout France during the uprisings."
