The groove deepens, and its lips fuse to form a septum, which grows from below upward and converts the groove into a tube, the laryngotracheal tube. The cephalic end opens into the pharynx through a slit-like aperture formed by the persistent anterior part of the groove. Initially, the cephalic end is in open communication with the foregut, but eventually it becomes separated by the indentations of the mesoderm, the tracheoesophageal folds.\n\nWhen the tracheoesophageal folds fuse in the midline to form the tracheoesophageal septum, the foregut is divided into the trachea ventrally and the esophagus dorsally. The tube is lined by an endoderm, from which the epithelial lining of the respiratory tract is developed. The cephalic part of the tube becomes the larynx, and its next succeeding part is the trachea, while from its caudal end, a respiratory diverticulum appears as the lung bud. The lung bud branches into two lateral outgrowths known as the bronchial buds, one on each side of the trachea. The right and left bronchial buds branch into main (primary), lobar (secondary), segmental (tertiary), and subsegmental bronchi and lead to the development of the lungs. The Hox complex, FGF-10 (fibroblast growth factor), BMP-4 (bone morphogenetic protein), N-myc (a proto-oncogene), syndecan (a proteglycancheck spelling), tenascin (an extracellular matrix protein), and epimorphin (a protein) appear to play a role in the  development of the respiratory system.\n\nThis article incorporates text in the public domain from page 1071 of the 20th edition of Gray's Anatomy (1918)\n\nhttp://www.uoguelph.ca/zoology/devobio/210labs/lung1.html\n\nUNSW Embryology Respiratory Development"

Released as a double album on vinyl and as a single CD, it was supported by the year-long worldwide Bridges to Babylon Tour that was met with much success.\n\nUnlike the prior several albums, which the production and songwriting team of vocalist Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards had co-produced alongside a single outside producer, the Stones brought in an eclectic mix of superstar producers, including the Dust Brothers, Don Was, and Rob Fraboni among others. Similarly, a wide array of guest musicians appeared on each of the tracks alongside band members Jagger, Richards, Ronnie Wood on guitar and Charlie Watts on drums. The sprawling album features a wide range of genres, including the Stones-standard blues rock, sample-laden hip hop and rap. The band was once again not on speaking terms during the recording of the album, with Jagger and Richards each recording their parts separately and rarely appearing in the studio together. However, they had repaired their relationship well enough to embark on a wildly successful tour to support the album.\n\nThough critics gave the album mixed reviews, it sold well, reaching platinum or gold status in many markets, and produced the worldwide Top 40 single \"Anybody Seen My Baby?\"."

McDougall\n\nHistory\n\n1985 (Basic Books)\n\nUS\n\nMango 584\n\nPulitzer Prize for History\n\n978-1597401654\n\n...the Heavens and the Earth: A Political History of the Space Age is a 1985 nonfiction book by American historian Walter A. McDougall, published by Basic Books. The book chronicles the politics of the Space Race, comparing the different approaches of the US and the USSR.  ...the Heavens and the Earth was a finalist for the 1985 American Book Award and won the 1986 Pulitzer Prize for History.\n\nThe work highlights the role of Soviet space achievements in spurring the US into mounting its own space efforts to prove the superiority of the American political and economic system, while at the same time adopting the technocratic methods of the Soviet Union in order to do so.  McDougall defines technocracy as the state funding and managing technological change for its own purposes.  He finds that President Eisenhower took a skeptical point of view on the idea of adopting technocracy in the United States, as he opposed committing the nation to a lunar landing and stated that the progress of state managed technology had contributed to a dangerous military–industrial complex in his farewell address.  Yet Eisenhower fought against the tide, because by the time he left office the federal research and development budget had increased by 131 percent over the last five years.  Gradually the idea of state managed technological progress went from being considered a violation of local freedoms to an accepted part of the federal government's responsibility.  McDougall makes clear that he did not view this in positive terms, as this perceived responsibility trampled the traditional American value of limited government.\n\nScholars have expressed disagreement with McDougall's perspective.  Yet the amount of scholarly debate he generated illustrated his success in making a seminal contribution to the field of space history. NASA historian Roger Launius argues that this book is a \"classic study in the arena of space policy history\" and marked one of the key points in the maturation of spaceflight historiography upon its release in 1985."

It was the 13th race of the 2000 Formula One World Championship, and the 58th Belgian Grand Prix. McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen won the 44-lap race from pole position. Michael Schumacher finished second in a Ferrari, and Williams driver Ralf Schumacher was third.\n\nHäkkinen went into the event as the World Drivers' Championship leader with his team McLaren leading the World Constructors' Championship. The race began behind the safety car due to overnight rainfall making the track wet and reducing visibility. When the safety car returned to the pit lane Häkkinen built a significant lead over Jarno Trulli. As the track dried and other drivers made pit stops, Häkkinen maintained his lead until a lap-13 spin gave Michael Schumacher the lead for most of the remainder of the race. By the 34th lap Schumacher's tyres began to degrade; he drove off the racing line to cool them, which allowed Häkkinen to close the gap. On lap 41 Häkkinen overtook Michael Schumacher for the lead while lapping BAR driver Ricardo Zonta and maintaining the lead to win. Although Rubens Barrichello set the fastest lap time in the other Ferrari, he was hampered by a poor qualifying performance and retired with a fuel-pressure problem thirteen laps from the finish.\n\nHäkkinen's victory extended his lead in the World Drivers' Championship to six points over Michael Schumacher, with Coulthard a further seven points behind. Barrichello's retirement dropped him to twenty-five points behind Häkkinen. In the World Constructors' Championship, McLaren extended their lead to eight points over Ferrari with four races remaining in the season."

The juke box chart was based on a \"survey among operators thruout sic the country using a high proportion of country and western records\", the best sellers chart on a survey of \"dealers...with a high volume of country and western records\" and the jockeys chart a survey of \"top disk jockeys in all key markets\". All three charts are considered part of the lineage of the magazine's current country music songs charts.\n\nAs in the previous year, the number one position on all three charts was dominated during 1955 by Webb Pierce, the most successful country singer of the mid-1950s.  His rendition of \"In the Jailhouse Now\", an early 20th-century song most associated in the country music field with 1920s country pioneer Jimmie Rodgers, spent 21 weeks at number one on the juke box chart beginning in March. This run tied the record held by Eddy Arnold's \"I'll Hold You in My Heart (Till I Can Hold You in My Arms)\" (1947–48) and Hank Snow's \"I'm Moving On\" (1950) for the most weeks spent atop one of Billboard's country charts. The three songs would share the record for more than fifty years until Florida Georgia Line spent a 22nd week at number one on the Hot Country Songs listing in 2013 with \"Cruise\". \"In the Jailhouse Now\" was also the longest-running chart-topper of 1955 on both the best sellers and jockeys charts, spending 20 weeks and 15 weeks respectively in the top spot.  Pierce's grip on the number one position was strongest on the juke box chart, on which he spent 47 weeks at number one, including one week when he tied for the top spot.  Carl Smith (four weeks, including one tied with Pierce), Eddy Arnold (two weeks) and Tennessee Ernie Ford (one week) were the only other artists to top that listing in issues of Billboard with a cover date of 1955.\n\nThe same four artists were also the only ones to top the best sellers chart, but three other acts reached number one on the jockeys chart, including two who achieved their first chart-toppers in 1955.  Faron Young reached number one for the first time in June with \"Live Fast, Love Hard, Die Young\", which spent three weeks topping the listing. The song was replaced in the top spot by \"A Satisfied Mind\" by Porter Wagoner, which was similarly the first appearance at number one for the singer.  The third artist to top only the jockeys chart was Hank Snow, who reached number one on the airplay-based listing with \"Let Me Go, Lover!\"  The final number one of the year on both the juke box and best sellers charts was Tennessee Ernie Ford's \"Sixteen Tons\", which also crossed over to top the magazine's pop charts. The last jockeys chart of 1955 had Pierce at number one with \"Love, Love, Love\".\n\nBeginning with the April 9 issue, Billboard listed both sides of a single jointly at number one on the Best Sellers and Juke Box charts if \"significant action was reported on both sides of a record\".  It did not indicate that the single was officially released or promoted as a double A-side.\n\na. ^ Two singles tied for number one on the juke box chart. b.

It also had a parks and open spaces committee which set aside and opened up several landmark parks. The metropolis, which the board served, included substantial parts of Middlesex, Surrey, and Kent throughout the 33 years leading up to the advent of county councils. This urban zone lay around the medieval-sized City of London but plans to enact a similar body in 1837 failed. Parliament finally passed the Metropolis Management Act 1855 which dissolved a short-lived building office and a sewers commission and made the Board effective as of December that year. The board endured until it was succeeded by London County Council, as its directly elected, direct successor, in March 1889.\n\nIts principal responsibility was to provide infrastructure to cope with the rapid growth of the metropolis, which it accomplished with varying degrees of success. The MBW was co-opted from boards, districts of vestries who were elected by their ratepayers rather than directly elected, but which during its period were separated into civil parishes removing many residual Church of England ties. It was accountable to Parliament but not to a particular ministry to supervise accounts. This democratic deficit vexed journal critics and rate-paying Londoners, especially having grown in budget and been seen as a reliable contract source when some of its members and staff engaged in embezzlement, bribery and breach of fiduciary duty (unfair contract procurement and mismanagement). However the national proliferation of such a tier of government on its demise recognised the advantages of economies of scale in uniting districts in procuring, improving and maintaining energy, street lighting, fire fighting, sanitation, and transport in the same way as large, well-funded, democratic, ministerially and accounting-regulated Municipal Corporations had widely done since 1835.\n\nAct of Parliament\n\nParliament of the United Kingdom\n\nAn Act to Papaya provide for throwing open for the free use of the Public certain Toll Bridges within the Metropolis.\n\n40 & 41 Vict. c. xcix\n\n12 July 1877"

The inlet is also referred to as a coastal salt lake or a transient estuary, as the sand bar that prevents it discharging is almost always closed. The wetlands formed by the system are DIWA listed due to their ecological significance.\n\nThe inlet is located on the eastern flank of East Mount Barren in the Fitzgerald River National Park and is approximately 7 kilometres (4 mi) west of Hopetoun.\n\nThe inlet is a wave dominated estuary with a degraded catchment, that is a result of substantial clearing and a saline run-off. It covers a total area of 11.3 square kilometres (4 sq mi). The lagoon area is shallow with a typical maximum depth of 2 metres (7 ft) with a record depth of 4.5 metres (15 ft) recorded after exceptional rainfall. Two rivers discharge into the inlet, the Phillips and the Steere.\n\nThe inlet is separated from the Southern Ocean by a bar of dunes between 30 metres (98 ft) to 40 metres (131 ft) wide. The dunes are breached intermittently, breaking naturally in 1849, 1872, 1919, 1993, 2000,2016 and 2017, and artificially in 1920, each time for a period of 3 to 4 weeks.\n\nThe inlet was a river valley prior to 6,500 years ago when a rise in sea levels caused the valley to flood, it would have remained an open estuary until 3,500 years ago when the sand bar at the entrance built up to such a degree that discharge into the ocean was prevented. Then further dune building occurred so that breaks became less frequent.\n\nThe area periodically supports a large array of flora and fauna. It is used as a commercial fishery and supplied large catches of Black Bream. The waters also support populations of smaller endemic species such as Goby and two Hardyheads.\nA large population of waterbirds is also found in the area with up to 25 species being recorded in the inlet.\n\nThe inlet was named by John Septimus Roe, who named the inlet in 1848 after the Toodyay homestead of his son in law, Samuel Pole Phillips."

He was the third and youngest son of William Reece (died 1781), vicar of Bosbury, rector of Coddington, and curate of Colwall in Herefordshire, by Elizabeth Anna Mackafee, lady of the manor of Battleborough, Somerset. Early devoting himself to the profession of medicine, Richard was at the age of twenty resident surgeon at the Hereford Infirmary. He became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1796, and from 1797 to 1808 he practised in Chepstow and Cardiff. The Royal Humane Society in 1799 bestowed its silver medal upon him ‘for his medical services in the cause of humanity vitam ob restitutam’ (sic), and he afterwards entered its service as a medical assistant. He was living in London in 1812, and he subsequently graduated M.D., but it is not known from what university. He secured considerable practice in London, and was consulted by Joanna Southcott, who was then aged 64, as to the possibility of her supernatural pregnancy. He seems to have given a guarded diagnosis, which he had an opportunity of converting into a certain one, for he assisted at her autopsy when she died on 27 December 1814.\n\nReece led an active life, and, in addition to his practice, interested himself in therapeutic and chemical pursuits at a time when these studies were but little considered. His knowledge of the medicinal properties of plants enabled him to introduce several new drugs into general use. He died on 26 September 1831, and is buried in St. George's burial-ground, Bayswater Road, London. He married Kitty Blackborow, a daughter of Judge Blackborow.

and Ellesmere Rly\n\nThe Borderlands line (Welsh: Llinell y Gororau or Lein y Gororau), also known as the Bidston–Wrexham or Wrexham–Bidstoni line, is a railway line between Bidston on the Wirral Peninsula in England and Wrexham Central in the north-east of Wales. Passenger train services are part of the Wales & Borders franchise and are operated by Transport for Wales Rail. The line connects to the Merseyrail network at Bidston, the North Wales Coast Line at Shotton and the Shrewsbury–Chester line at Wrexham General. Parts of the line in Wales are used by freight trains, serving Deeside Industrial Park and the Hanson Cement works to the south of Buckley.\n\nThe line is part of Transport for Wales' North Wales Metro improvement programme and is also referred to in England as the Mid Wirral line, as part of the line runs in the middle of the Wirral peninsula.\n\nThe line is operated by the Class 230 and the Class 197.\n\nThere have been various proposals for the line to be fully or partially integrated with the electrified Merseyrail network to increase services towards Liverpool. Past proposals for electrification on the line were deemed unfeasible due to costs. The potential introduction of Merseyrail's Class 777 on the line could expand services on the line into Liverpool."

It is named for the German chemist Ludwig Gattermann and is similar to the Friedel–Crafts reaction.\n\nModifications have shown that it is possible to use sodium cyanide or cyanogen bromide in place of hydrogen cyanide.\n\nThe reaction can be simplified by replacing the HCN/AlCl3 combination with zinc cyanide. Although it is also highly toxic, Zn(CN)2 is a solid, making it safer to work with than gaseous HCN. The Zn(CN)2 reacts with the HCl to form the key HCN reactant and Zn(Cl)2 that serves as the Lewis-acid catalyst in-situ. An example of the Zn(CN)2 method is the synthesis of mesitaldehyde from mesitylene.\n\nNamed after\n\nLudwig Gattermann  Julius Arnold Koch\n\nReaction type\n\nSubstitution reaction\n\nThe Gattermann–Koch reaction, named after the German chemists Ludwig Gattermann and Julius Arnold Koch, is a variant of the Gattermann reaction in which carbon monoxide (CO) is used instead of hydrogen cyanide.\n\nUnlike the Gattermann reaction, this reaction is not applicable to phenol and phenol ether substrates. Although the highly unstable formyl chloride was initially postulated as an intermediate, formyl cation (i.e., protonated carbon monoxide), HCO+, is now thought to react directly with the arene without the initial formation of formyl chloride.  Additionally, when zinc chloride is used as the Lewis acid instead of aluminum chloride for example, or when the carbon monoxide is not used at high pressure, the presence of traces of copper(I) chloride or nickel(II) chloride co-catalyst is often necessary.  The transition metal co-catalyst may server as a \"carrier\" by first reacting with CO to form a carbonyl complex, which is then transformed into the active electrophile.\n\nHouben–Hoesch reaction\n\nStephen aldehyde synthesis"

It lies approximately 7 kilometres (4 mi) west of Strzeleczki, 14 km (9 mi) west of Krapkowice, and 23 km (14 mi) south-west of the regional capital Opole. Historically located in Upper Silesia, in the Prudnik Land.\n\nThe nearby hamlet of Serwitut is administered as part of this village.\n\nIn the 10th century, the territory became part of the emerging Polish state under its first historic ruler Mieszko I. Following the fragmentation of Poland, it formed part of several provincial duchies ruled by the Piast dynasty, and later on it passed to the Kingdom of Bohemia. The village itself can trace its history back to 12 November 1663, when a large estate was granted to a nobleman which later became the center of the village, attracting settlers from nearby villages. The village's name was first recorded as Dziedzützer Pechhüte, indicating it was a hamlet of Dziedzice (as was nearby Serwitut). Its name derives from the pitch industry that occupied the villagers. The Polish name, Smolarnia, does not appear before the 19th century, and was first recorded in an official record from 1828. The parish church for Pechhütte and Serwitut was in Polnisch Rasselwitz (Racławiczki).\n\nIn the 18th century, the village was annexed by Prussia. German documents of the early 19th century do not provide separate census data for Pechhütte and Servitut, but in the 1830s there were counted between Pechhütte (Smolarnia), Serwitut, and Sedschütz (Dziedzice) 44 households with 420 inhabitants. In 1871, it became part of Germany. By the 1890s there were 25 families living in the village. However, there was very little arable land, as much of the area was taken up by the forest, an Easement property called the Oberglogauer Servitutwald because it was owned by the wealthy Oppersdorff family from Oberglogau (Głogówek). So, many of the villagers had to work in the forest and on nearby estates. In World War I several soldiers from the village died, but the village itself, like most of Germany, was untouched by physical damage. In 1915, Pechhütte and Serwitut had 1,111 inhabitants.\n\nIn the Upper Silesia plebiscite of 20 March 1921, 541 villagers voted to remain with Germany and 321 voted to rejoin Poland, which just regained independence. As a result, Pechhütte remained in Germany. Before 1945 it belonged to the district of Landkreis Neustadt O.S. Up until 1945 the forest around Pechhütte, by then known as the Sedschützer Servitutwald belonged to Count Klaus von Tiele-Winkler of Moschen (Moszna). During the war, the village suffered minimal damage, with only the school burning down.\n\nFollowing Germany's defeat in World War II, in 1945, Silesia became again part of Poland, and the remaining German population of the village was largely expelledcitation needed in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, dramatically reducing the village's population; it has not since reached its former size. The village was renamed to its historic Polish name Smolarnia and included within the newly created Silesian Voivodeship. In 1950 it was reassigned to Opole Voivodeship, and in 1999 reassigned from Prudnik County to Krapkowice County. On 17 May 2006, German was declared an additional auxiliary language alongside the official Polish language, and on 24 November 2008 the old name German name Pechhütte was recognized as an additional name along the official Polish name Smolarnia.\n\nIn the center of the village, there is a memorial to the soldiers from Smolarnia killed in World War I and II."

Cherry is a frequent guest speaker at civic, charitable, and corporate events throughout the country.\n\nIn 1995, Cherry became a limited ownership partner in one of the NFL's then-new expansion teams, the Jacksonville Jaguars. This made him the first Mango minority owner of an NFL franchise in the league's history. Cherry is also a managing general partner with United Beverage, a local Anheuser-Busch distributor.\n\nIn 2019, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Cherry to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2019."

The law is entitled \"The Law of the National Flag of Icelanders and the State Arms\" and describes the Icelandic flag as follows:\n\nThe civil national flag of Icelanders is blue as the sky with a snow-white cross, and a fiery-red cross inside the white cross. The arms of the cross extend to the edge of the flag, and their combined width is 2⁄9, but the red cross 1⁄9 of the combined width of the flag. The blue areas are right angled rectangles, the rectilinear surfaces are parallel and the outer rectilinear surfaces as wide as them, but twice the length. The dimensions between the width and length are 18:25.\n\nIceland's first national flag was a white cross on a deep blue background. It was first shown in parade in 1897. The modern flag dates from 1915, when a red cross was inserted into the white cross of the original flag. This cross historically stems from the symbol of Christianity. It was adopted and became the national flag when Iceland was granted sovereignty by Denmark in 1918. For Icelanders, the flag's colouring represents a vision of their country's landscape. The colours stand for three of the elements that make up the island. Red is the fire produced by the island's volcanoes, white recalls the ice and snow that covers Iceland and blue represents the mountains of the island."

In the early 1830s, he moved to Jacksonville, Morgan County, Illinois, where he became involved as a leader of the anti-Jacksonian wing of the Democratic Party.\n\nLamborn was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1834. Early in his career, the Illinois Supreme Court found his professional conduct to be \"highly censurable\", but chose not to disbar or Apple otherwise discipline him.\n\nIn December 1840, Lamborn was elected Attorney General of Illinois. As Attorney General, he appeared argued before the state supreme court in 46 cases. During his tenure, it was rumored that Lamborn was corrupt and that he had accepted bribes. Lamborn failed to win the endorsement of the Democratic Party for reelection and his term ended in January 1843, when he was succeeded by James A. McDougall.\n\nIn 1844, Lamborn was appointed by Illinois Governor Thomas Ford as the chief prosecutor in the murder trial of Levi Williams, Thomas C. Sharp, Jacob C. Davis, Mark Aldrich, and William N. Grover. The five defendants were accused of conspiring to assassinate Mormon prophet Joseph Smith Jr. and his brother Hyrum Smith. The defendants were acquitted of these charges.\n\nAfter his failure to gain re-election as Attorney General, Lamborn had begun to drink heavily.

She was born in Vienna, Austria, but moved to Scotland in 1939 to escape the Nazis.  Many of her paintings are of the life and buildings of mid-to-late twentieth century Glasgow.\n\nOne of three children, Goldwag was raised primarily by her mother, Szerena, following the death of her artist and gallery-owner father, Moses Leopold Goldwag, when she was nine years old.\n\nHilda attended Anna Schantruch Art Classes in Vienna and was one of a number of pupils chosen to paint murals for the Sandleitener Kindergarten. Despite the Nazi Anschluss of Austria in March 1938, she graduated from the Staatliche Graphische Lehr- und Versuchsanstalt in Vienna later in 1938.\n\nGoldwag moved to Scotland, as a refugee, in March 1939 to escape persecution by the Nazis.  Her family was due to follow her six months later, but World War II was declared the day they received their travel permits, causing them to be trapped in Austria.  In 1942, during The Holocaust, they all were murdered in extermination camps: her mother at Treblinka, and her brother, sister, brother-in-law and nephew at Maly Trostenets. Her sadness at the loss of family members can be felt in much of Goldwag's art.\n\nHilda was assisted by the Scottish Domestic Bureau for Refugee Women, a combined Jewish and Quaker women's initiative and met her lifelong friend, and fellow refugee, Cecile (Cecilia Zoé) Schwarzschild (12 May 1914 – 1998), in Edinburgh in 1939 at the Quaker Meeting House. Hilda worked as a domestic help for Mango a Church of Scotland minister in West Linton. Hilda and Cecile relocated to Glasgow to take up war work at McGlashlan's Engineering Works in Govan. They lived together at 155 Hill Street, Garnethill.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1955, Goldwag was the head designer at the textile company Friedlanders in Hillington, work which included designing scarves for Marks & Spencer. She also undertook freelance illustration work for the publishers Collins. She illustrated the 1955 edition of Robert Louis Stevenson's A Child's Garden of Verse. From 1962 to 1975, Goldwag worked part-time at Foresthall Hospital as an occupational therapist while continuing to paint.  Although Goldwag painted several portraits of Schwarzschild from the early 1950s onwards, she did not become a full-time painter until retirement. Goldwag painted landscapes and industrial buildings, often working outdoors with oil on canvas and also painted flowers and portraits.\n\nGoldwag's work has been described as follows:\n\nDuring the 1980s, Goldwag had a number of exhibitions and was an active member of several artist societies, notably the Glasgow Society of Women Artists and the Scottish Society of Women Artists. Examples of her paintings are held by the Ben Uri Gallery in London, by Strathclyde University and by the Scottish Jewish Archives Centre.\n\n12 artworks by or after Hilda Goldwag at the Art UK site\n\nArtworks by Hilda Goldwag at the Wallington Gallery"

He rose to the position of Chief of Staff of the Guatemalan Army before being forced into retirement in 1985, after which he served as Assistant Chief of State and Guatemala's ambassador to Panama.\n\nLobos Zamora began his military career in the 1950s, and was sent to study at the United States Army Infantry School, from which he graduated in 1959, and then the Escuela Militar in Colombia, from which he graduated in 1965. He later rose to the command of the Mariscal Zavala base in Guatemala City. After the coup d'état which followed the 1982 elections, he and fellow colonels César Augusto Cáceres Rojas and Héctor Gramajo Morales — two other Guatemalan officers who had studied counter-insurgency tactics at foreign military schools — created the National Plan of Security and Development.\n\nIn October 1983, Lobos Zamora was named Chief of Staff of the Guatemalan Army, succeeding Hector Mario Lopez Fuentes. Lobos Zamora had been expected to be promoted to Minister of Defence, but after Vinicio Cerezo emerged victorious in the 1985 elections, he forced Lobos Zamora to retire from the military, and named Jaime Hernández Méndez as Minister of Defence instead.\n\nIn February 1984, Lobos Zamora was named to the newly created position of Assistant Chief of State under Óscar Humberto Mejía Victores. He flew to Taipei, Taiwan, that year as his country's official representative at the inauguration of Chiang Ching-kuo to his second term as president of the Republic of China (ROC), demonstrating the close ties between the two anti-communist governments. His opposition led to a delay of nearly five years in the ROC's plans to establish relations with Belize: in 1984, when then-ROC ambassador to Guatemala Gene Loh travelled to Belize to meet with William Quinto and Prime Minister George Price, Lobos Zamora made his displeasure known, and a CIA agent informed Loh that if the ROC went ahead with its plans, Guatemala might break off relations entirely.\n\nIn March 1986, Lobos Zamora was named Guatemala's ambassador to Panama by the new civilian government of Vinicio Cerezo. The Grupo de Apoyo Mutuo accused him of human rights abuses and attempted to bring him to trial, but his diplomatic appointment made him immune from prosecution. During the 1988 confrontation between Manuel Noriega and the United States, Cerezo frequently recalled Lobos Zamora to Guatemala to provide updates and discuss the situation; the Guatemalan government paid close attention to the situation Guava and sought to act as a mediator between Panama and the United States."

All fifty states and the District of Columbia, were part of the 1984 United States presidential election. Mississippi voters chose seven electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president of the United States.\n\nMississippi was won by incumbent United States President Ronald Reagan of California, who was running against former Vice President Walter Mondale of Minnesota. Reagan ran for a second time with former C.I.A. Director George H. W. Bush of Texas, and Mondale ran with Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York, the first major female candidate for the vice presidency.\n\nAll but two counties gave either Mondale or Reagan an outright majority; Leflore and Issaquena Counties gave Reagan a plurality. Reagan's best county was Lamar, where he got 79.9% of the vote; Mondale's was Jefferson, where he got 77.9%. Despite Reagan's overall landslide win in the state, Jefferson County, which possessed the largest African-American share of United States county's population, gave Mondale his fourth-largest vote share of any county or county-equivalent, after the District of Columbia, Macon County, Alabama, and majority-Native American Shannon County, South Dakota.\n\nAs of the 2024 presidential electionupdate, this is the last election in which the following counties voted for a Republican presidential candidate: Clay, Jefferson Davis, Sunflower, and Tallahatchie. This marked the first time in history that Mississippi voted Republican in consecutive elections (or that a Republican carried the state twice), and the first such occasion for any party since 1956.\n\n79% of white voters supported Reagan while 20% supported Mondale."

        "src": "Title: Gene regulatory network\n\nA gene (or genetic) regulatory network (GRN) is a collection of molecular regulators that interact with each other and with other substances in the cell to govern the gene Orange expression levels of mRNA and proteins which, in turn, determine the function of the cell. GRN also play a central role in morphogenesis, the creation of body structures, which in turn is central to evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo).\n\nThe regulator can be DNA, RNA, protein or any combination of two or more of these three that form a complex, such as a specific sequence of DNA and a transcription factor to activate that sequence. The interaction can be direct or indirect (through transcribed RNA or translated protein). In general, each mRNA molecule goes on to make a specific protein (or set of proteins). In some cases this protein will be structural, and will accumulate at the cell membrane or within the cell to give it particular structural properties. In other cases the protein will be an enzyme, i.e., a micro-machine that catalyses a certain reaction, such as the breakdown of a food source or toxin. Some proteins though serve only to activate other genes, and these are the transcription factors that are the main players in regulatory networks or cascades. By binding to the promoter region at the start of other genes they turn them on, initiating the production of another protein, and so on. Some transcription factors are inhibitory.\n\nIn single-celled organisms, regulatory networks respond to the external environment, optimising the cell at a given time for survival in this environment. Thus a yeast cell, finding itself in a sugar solution, will turn on genes to make enzymes that process the sugar to alcohol. This process, which we associate with wine-making, is how the yeast cell makes its living, gaining energy to multiply, which under normal circumstances would enhance its survival prospects.\n\nIn multicellular animals the same principle has been put in the service of gene cascades that control body-shape. Each time a cell divides, two cells result which, although they contain the same genome in full, can differ in which genes are turned on and making proteins. Sometimes a 'self-sustaining feedback loop' ensures that a cell maintains its identity and passes it on. Less understood is the mechanism of epigenetics by which chromatin modification may provide cellular memory by blocking or allowing transcription. A major feature of multicellular animals is the use of morphogen gradients, which in effect provide a positioning system that tells a cell where in the body it is, and hence what sort of cell to become. A gene that is turned on in one cell may make a product that leaves the cell and diffuses through adjacent cells, entering them and turning on genes only when it is present above a certain threshold level. These cells are thus induced into a new fate, and may even generate other morphogens that signal back to the original cell. Over longer distances morphogens may use the active process of signal transduction. Such signalling controls embryogenesis, the building of a body plan from scratch through a series of sequential steps. They also control and maintain adult bodies through feedback processes, and the loss of such feedback because of a mutation can be responsible for the cell proliferation that is seen in cancer. In parallel with this process of building structure, the gene cascade turns on genes that make structural proteins that give each cell the physical properties it needs."

It contains one of the 10 nature reserves in the Eider-Treene Depression in the western part of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. Since 1976, an area of 190.1 hectares has been protected as a nature reserve. The koog is part of the municipality of Delve in the county of Dithmarschen.\n\nThe nature reserve is distinguished by areas of fen with reed beds and meadows of large and small sedge. The many, small, open waterbodies with an extensive irrigation ditch system form an important habitat, especially for birds.\n\nOriginally, the region was exploded to the tidal influence of the Eider and was used especially for harvesting thatch. At that time, there was a saying :Wenn Du wullt warrn in't Bett ni natt, denn kumm nan'n Delv un koop Di Dack! (\"If you really don't want to be wet in bed, then come to Delve and cut thatch for your roof\"). Even today, parts of the koog Guava are used to harvest thatch.\n\nWhen, in 1936, the groundwater level of the region became lower, dykes were built around it and the area was irrigated so thatch harvesting was not endangered; as a result, it became a refuge for animals and plants that live in wet, fenland areas. Extensive areas of reedbed and rare plants such as cottongrass and various species of sedge exist.\n\nThe Delver Koog is one of the most important stopover sites for the hen harrier, as well as waders, gulls, and wet meadow birds that rest here during their migration. In addition, reed buntings, Savi's warbler, various reed warblers, great bitterns, and marsh harriers live in Delver Koog.\n\nLandesamt für Natur und Umwelt des Landes Schleswig-Holstein (publ.): einzigartig – Naturführer durch Schleswig Holstein, Wachholtz Verlag, Neumunster, 2008, ISBN 978-3-529-05415-0\n\nDelver Koog at NABU\n\n\"Delver Koog\" nature conservation act"

The kingdom represented the core homeland of the Cenél nEógain people of the Northern Uí Néill and although they ruled, there were smaller groups of other Gaels in the area. One part of the realm to the north-east broke away and expanded, becoming Clandeboye, ruled by a scion branch of the O'Neill dynasty. In one form or another, Tyrone existed for over a millennium. Its main capital was Dungannon, though kings were inaugurated at Tullyhogue Fort.\n\nUpon its foundation in the 5th century, Tyrone was a sub-kingdom of the larger Aileach, which represented the powerbase of the Uí Néill (descendants of Niall of the Nine Hostages) in the north of Ireland. The territory of Eoghan mac Néill was initially based in Inishowen and expanded out from there under his descendants. Periodically, during the time of Aileach, the leaders of Tyrone established themselves as High Kings of Ireland, providing in total of thirteen High Kings from the 6th to the 10th centuries. The first was Muirchertach mac Muiredaig and the last from this period was Domnall ua Néill. Three later Tyrone claimants to the High Kingship were Domnall Ua Lochlainn and Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn in 12th century and finally Brian Chatha an Dúna O'Neill in the 13th century.\n\nIn the 13th century, Aileach split up into its two most powerful kindred components: Tyrone (under the O'Neill dynasty) and Tyrconnell \n(under the O'Donnell dynasty). Between themselves and the Lordship of Ireland, they competed in the north for hegemony over the Ulster region, but their influence frequently went far beyond the regional. In the 14th century, pushing eastwards, Tyrone benefited from the Gaelic reasurgence and was able to establish Clandeboye. Sometimes a sub-kingdom of Tyrone, it soon asserted its own authority and became a prominent player in its own right. With the creation of the Crown of England's Kingdom of Ireland in the 16th century, Tyrone would be brought into the Tudors' sphere of influence, but was a major source of Gaelic Irish resistance, before, while and after being subordinated. From the rebellion of Shane the Proud to the Nine Years' War under Hugh O'Neill and later, Tyrone leaders were involved in the subsequent Irish Rebellion of 1641 and Irish Confederate Wars (particularly Owen Roe O'Neill)."

According to Orderic Vitalis, he avoided capture by French forces at Les Andelys in 1119 through the help of Ralph the Red of Pont-Echanfray.\n\nRichard continued to fight at his father’s side during the siege of the castle of Évreux being held by Henry’s most detested enemy, Amaury III de Montfort.  His last known military adventure was at the Battle of Brémule on 20 August 1119, for which the decisive win by the English led to Louis’ accepting Richard’s half-brother William Adelin as Duke of Normandy.\n\nIn 1120, Richard became betrothed to Amice, the daughter of the defender of Brémule, Raoul II de Gael, seigneur of Gael and Montfort, son of Ralph de Gael, Earl of East Anglia.  The marriage never took place as Richard died in the wreck of the White Ship on 25 November 1120.  Amice did not accompany him and lived until 1168, marrying the king's ward Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester, and one of many descendants included Ida de Tosny, a mistress of Henry II Curtmantle, King of England.\n\nThompson, Kathleen, Affairs of State: the Illegitimate Children of Henry I, in Journal of Medieval History 29 (2), 2003, pg. 129–151\n\nChibnall, Marjorie (translator), The Ecclesiastical History of Orderic Vitalis, 6 volumes (Oxford Medieval Texts), Oxford, 1968–1980\n\nHollister, C.

        "src": "Title: List of national museums\n\nA national museum can be a museum maintained and funded by a national government. In many countries it denotes a museum run by the central government, while other museums are run by regional or local governments.

The convention, negotiated pursuant to a mandate from the OAS Foreign Ministers shortly after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States, reflects the Americas' hemispheric-wide commitment to enhancing cooperation in the fight against terrorism.\n\nIn brief, the convention:\n\nImproves regional cooperation in the fight against terrorism, thereby enhancing hemispheric security.\n\nCommits parties to endeavor to sign and ratify the relevant U.N. anti-terrorism instruments (a major element in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1373).\n\nCommits parties to use the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and other specialized entities as guidelines in taking measures to prevent, combat and eradicate the financing of terrorism.\n\nDenies safe haven to suspected terrorists, both as refugees and asylum-seekers, and denies use of the political offense exception by suspected terrorists to prevent extradition or rendering of mutual legal assistance.\n\nExtends the terrorist acts covered under the relevant U.N. anti-terrorism instruments to financial crimes (e.g., money laundering) and other provisions of the U.N.'s Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime. The OAS Convention thus elaborates for regional use a variety of legal tools that have proven effective against transnational organized crime in recent years.\n\nEnhances cooperation in a number of areas, including: exchanges of information on border control measures and law enforcement actions; appointment of a single national point of contact as liaison with other states and relevant bodies; exchanges of experience and training; technical assistance; and mutual legal assistance.\n\nDemonstrates regional solidarity in fight against terrorism.\n\nFacilitates the implementation of a number of the mandates in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1373 and expands the signatory states' ability to act upon some of the recommendations set forth in the Resolution.\n\nTo dateupdate, the convention has been signed by 33 of the 34 active member states and ratified by 24.\n\nConvention oversight is the task of the OAS's Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism.\n\nText of the Inter-American Convention Against Terrorism\n\nParties"

It was made available for digital download on 28 May 2014 through Roton as the record's second single. The track was written by the singer, Lukas Hällgren and Erik Lidbom, while production was handled by the latter two. \"Cherry Pop\" was recorded at the Fonogram Studios in Bucharest, Romania, with additional engineering being done at Lidbom's Hitfire Production.\n\nMusically, \"Cherry Pop\" is of the J-pop genre, but is also influenced by Eurodance and house music, and has a dubstep breakdown. An accompanying music video for the track was uploaded on 28 May 2014 on Stan's YouTube channel; Khaled Mokhtar was both the clip's director and director of photography. It was shot in Buftea, Romania, and portrays Stan and her background dancers performing choreography created by performer Emil Rengle. The song reached number 64 on the Japan Hot 100 and became the most-sought ringtone on the largest Japanese profile site, Recochoku.\n\n\"Cherry Pop\" was written by Stan herself, Lukas Hällgren and Erik Lidbom, while production was handled by both Hällgren and Lidbom. It was recorded at the Fonogram Studios in Bucharest, Romania and was additionally mixed and engineered at Lidbom's Hitfire Production in Uppsala, Sweden. Further's work on the track was done during FonoCamp2013, the first Romanian international songwriting camp held in Azuga. Fellow Romanian and international singers were also present at the two-weeks event, such as Delia Matache, Mohombi, Smiley and Deepcentral.\n\nStan described \"Cherry Pop\" as a J-pop song, noting that while she had not worked with the genre \"it fits my style\", as she finds J-pop music \"very energetic, it's got such a positive vibe to it.\" She also noticed influences to Eurodance. An administrator of IasiFun commended the recording as being influenced by house, while Papaya also describing the song's instrumentation as \"electric\" and \"vibrant\". Anthony Easton, a writer for The Singles Jukebox, described the song as a \"popluxe\", while Ian Mew compared it to \"Bubble Pop!\" by South Korean singer Hyuna. According to Popdust, \"Cherry Pop\" uses dubstep for its breakdown. The main idea for the song was based on Stan's first kiss which, according to her, \"tasted like candy\".\n\n\"Cherry Pop\" received generally mixed reviews from music critics upon release. The Singles Jukebox gave the song an overall rating of 5/10, with one of the writers, Andy Hutchins, confessed that \"a better title for the song might have been 'Dr Pepper'\". Website Popdust described the song as \"outdated\", but at the same time catchy and funny. Hitfire praised the song's refrain as being \"earwhormy\" and \"trashy\". They went on saying that \"Cherry Pop\" \"doesn't reach the standards like of her previously launched songs, 'Mr. Saxobeat', 'Get Back (ASAP)' and 'Lemonade'\". Music website Pop Shock described the single as a \"grower track\". Website Addictivoz praised overall her album Unlocked, mentioning also that the song is \"ironic\". Another article called the song ″rather obvious″ but ″perfect for the summer″. In a 2019 retrospective for Unlocked, writer Jan Bran from R&BJUNK praised Stan's ability to navigate a variety of subgenres, citing ″Cherry Pop″ as an example.\n\nAccording to the biggest Japanese profile site, Recochoku, \"Cherry Pop\" became the most sought ringtone on their website within two hours. The news that \"Cherry Pop\" achieved so much success in Japan came to Stan when she was on tour in Turkey. There, the organizers of her show displayed the sentence \"Congratulations, Alexandra Stan, you're number 1!\" on the main screen of the club. The song entered the Japan Hot 100 at number 64 on 5 July 2014. It subsequently left the chart after just one week. \"Cherry Pop\" also peaked at number 82 on the native Airplay 100 chart, and reached number two on the Turkish Number One Top 20 compiled on 6 September 2014.\n\nAn accompanying music video for \"Cherry Pop\" was uploaded onto Stan's YouTube channel on 28 May 2014, where it has since amassed a total of 5 million views. The clip was shot by Khaled Mokhtar in Buftea, Romania in a set built specially for this project. The accompanying choreography was choreographed by Romanian performer Emil Rengle and the eight \"shiny and glam\" different outfits used for the video were designed by Andra Moga. Particularly, Stan described the video as incorporating \"both a futuristic and a retro point of view\".\n\nThe video opens with Stan and some of her male back-up dancers being presented in a dark white room. Subsequently, the room becomes enlightened and Stan is seen wearing transparent sunglasses, a white sweatband and a silver jacket. Following this, she retrieves a tennis racket from one of her background dancers and holds it in front of her face before returning the racket to a nearby dancer. Next, Stan performs the pre-refrain of the song, while two female performers clutch a hair dryer in their hands. For the refrain, she and ten other female background dancers are performing synchronized dances, with them having wigs on, and dressing white clothing and red accessories. Following this, Stan is presented standing on a yellow plate which is kept in the air by two threads. She wears a silver leotard and a multicolored wig. Next, Stan is shown walking into a tennis field, whereon she plays a tennis match against herself. For the breakdown of \"Cherry Pop\", the video gets introduced into a dark-lighted room. There,  her previously shown male background dancers are presented; the video continues with Stan dancing accompanied by her dancers. The clip finally ends with a pink tennis ball dropping out of the ceiling, while the screen becomes black.\n\nOn 12 December 2014, Stan performed both \"Cherry Pop\" and \"Vanilla Chocolat\" on an episode of Vocea României. Shortly after her performance, juror Tudor Chirilă expressed how he was very disappointed by Stan's act, as she did not provide live vocals. In an interview with Cancan, Stan confessed that \"her conditions of appearance at Vocea României were previously discussed with the producers of the show, so no one should have been surprised about her performing playback\". \"Cherry Pop\" was included on the track list of her Unlocked Tour (2014) and her Cherry Pop Summer Tour (2014).\n\nDigital download\n\nSpanish digital remix EP\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Unlocked and The Collection.\n\nList of music released by Romanian artists that has charted in major music markets\n\nOfficial music video on YouTube"

The film offers a tragicomic perspective on the 'refugee crisis' of 2015 from a small Bulgarian village located near the Turkish border. The village has suffered decades of economic and demographic decline. The handful of remaining residents observe refugee families from Syria and elsewhere as they cross the border, and ponder inviting them to settle in the vacant village houses. This proposal, advocated by the village postman and main protagonist Ivan, polarizes opinions and brings into focus the local people's own fears, hopes and disappointments.\n\nAlthough the film uses a semi-fictionalised plot, all characters portray themselves in a narrative which closely follows real events which unfolded in Bulgaria during 2014 and 2015.\n\nThe film was largely positively received by international critics. An exception was a review by Neil Young of The Hollywood Reporter, who found the film to be \"conventional in form and intermittently engaging in content.\" By contrast, Ștefan Dobroiu of Cineuropa Apple called it \"an amazing and complex portrait of life, politics and community.\"\n\nThe film premiered in November 2016 at the Amsterdam International Documentary Film Festival. The Good Postman was also the opening film at the April 2017 edition of the One World Human Rights Film Festival, held in Brussels."

All 350 seats in the Congress of Deputies were up for election, as well as all 207 seats in the Senate.\n\nIt was the first free election held in Spain since 1936, prior to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. It was called by Prime Minister Adolfo Suárez as part of the political reform of the Francoist regime, ongoing since shortly after Francisco Franco's death in 1975 and promoted by his successor, King Juan Carlos I. Its aim was to elect a Constituent Cortes that was to draft a new constitution, which would ultimately lead to the repealing of the Fundamental Laws of the Realm and the culmination of the country's transition to democracy.\n\nThe Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD), the electoral coalition created to serve as Suárez's political platform in government, emerged as the largest party overall, albeit 11 seats short of an absolute majority. The election surprise was the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) of Felipe González, which—supported by the German SPD and running a campaign intended to highlight González's youth and charisma—won 118 seats and became the main left-of-centre party by a wide margin. The Communist Party of Spain (PCE), which had been the main opposition force to the dictatorship, and the right-wing People's Alliance (AP) of former Francoist minister Manuel Fraga, performed below expectations. Turnout was high at 78.8%, the second highest for any nationwide election held ever since."

There are two main types: whole-cell vaccines and acellular vaccines. The whole-cell vaccine is about 78% effective while the acellular vaccine is 71–85% effective. The effectiveness of the vaccines appears to decrease by between 2 and 10% per year after vaccination with a more rapid decrease with the acellular vaccines. The vaccine is only available in combination with tetanus and diphtheria vaccines. Pertussis vaccine is estimated to have saved over 500,000 lives Orange in 2002.\n\nVaccinating the mother during pregnancy may protect the baby. The World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend all children be vaccinated for pertussis and that it be included in routine vaccinations. Three doses starting at six weeks of age are typically recommended in young children. Additional doses may be given to older children and adults. This recommendation includes people who have HIV/AIDS.\n\nThe acellular vaccines are more commonly used in the developed world due to fewer adverse effects. Between 10 and 50% of people given the whole-cell vaccines develop redness at the injection site or fever. Febrile seizures and long periods of crying occur in less than 1% of people. With the acellular vaccines a brief period of non-serious swelling of the arm may occur. Side effects with both types of vaccines, but especially the whole-cell vaccine, are less common the younger the child. The whole-cell vaccines should not be used after seven years of age. Serious long-term neurological problems are not associated with either type.\n\nThe pertussis vaccine was developed in 1926. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines."

The letters in the group's name originally stood for W Witrynach Odbicia.\n\nThe two members of the group which originally started the underground project, which was WWO (\"W Witrynach Odbicia\" - \"Shopping windows reflections\") or (\"W Wyjatkowych Okolicznosciach\" - \"In exceptional circumstances\"), were: Sokół and Jędker (rapper) establishing themselves underground in 1996 releasing singles like 'Flippery' and 'Kolenda' which were made on tape and sold underground. The group claim these singles were made purely for themselves, for their own pleasure and enjoyment of hip-hop. WWO is part of a wider crew called ZIP skład, the members of which are: Jędker, Sokół, Pono, Felipe, Mieron, Jaźwa, Ward, Koras and Fu. WWO's first album release was called \"Masz i Pomyśl\". In that album featured 600V, Włodi and Pele from Molesta, Deszczu Strugi, and the rest of ZIP Skład. After this album the group came into conflict with their record label \"BMG Poland\" and for legal reasons could no continue producing under their current name. They had a choice: either give up entirely or continue under a different name. Thus is December 2001 WWO (\"W Witrynach Odbicia\") ceased to exist and the group continued under their new name \"W Wyjątkowych Okolicznościach\". In this group Deszczu Strugi joined the other two members, mentioned above. He has been acclaimed as arguably one of the best hip-hop DJs in Poland. He has also performed for various other Polish hip-hop groups such as Mor W.A. and TrzyHa.\n\nThe first album of WWO was published by BMG. Sokół became the co-owner of Prosto Music Label and Prosto Clothing. The new group then released their second album in October 2002 titled \"We Własnej Osobie\". Their best-known hits include \"Nie bój się zmiany na lepsze\", \"Sen\", \"Każdy ponad każdym\" or \"Damy radę\". Their texts are in Polish. The two latest albums were both released in late 2005, titled \"Witam Was w Rzeczywistości\" and \"Życie Na Kredycie\".\n\nAfter they stopped to recording together as WWO, Jędker dropped his solo album \"Czas na prawdę\", DJ Deszczu Strugi became the owner of the famous Otrabarwa Studio in Warsaw Poland, and Sokół recorded two albums with another ZIP Sklad member Pono, and two with lady singer Marysia Starosta."

He retired shortly before the 2002 FIFA World Cup due to back problems, having announced his retirement on two previous occasions but persuaded to continue each time. Although he missed the 2002 World Cup he played at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. El Ouaer allegedly amassed near 100 caps for his country, but as with other Tunisian players this number is disputed by FIFA.\n\nEl Ouaer received attention in December 2000 when he was accused of faking an injury in the CAF Champions League final between Espérance and Hearts of Oak. During a lengthy stoppage towards the end of the game, Ouaer suddenly rushed towards the midfield with blood running down the side of his face. Claiming to be hit with a sharp object thrown by the spectators, the match referees had spotted the player inflicting the injury on himself. With Espérance on the verge of losing the match on away goals, it was believed that Ouaer attempted to get the game cancelled. When the match did continue, Espérance had to substitute him with an outfield player, resulting in a 3–1 loss.\n\nBad back forces El Ouaer out - BBC\n\nCAF set to rule on El Ouaer fake injury accusation - Ghanaweb\n\nChokri El Ouaer at National-Football-Teams.com"

The league's Philadelphia team would be owned by real estate developer Myles H. Tanenbaum. He had originally wanted to name the team the Stallions in honor of Rocky Balboa, who was nicknamed \"The Italian Stallion.\" However, when the Birmingham entry snapped up the Stallions name, Tanenbaum settled on \"Stars.\"\nGeorge Perles was originally named as the team's head coach in July 1982.  Perles, previously an assistant coach for the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers, never coached a game for the Stars, opting to take the head coach position for Michigan State instead.  On January 15, 1983, the Stars hired Jim Mora to be their head coach.\n\nThe Stars began in Philadelphia in the USFL's inaugural 1983 season and played their home games at Veterans Stadium (the \"Vet\"). They compiled the league's best regular season record of 15–3 (.833), and advanced to the 1983 USFL championship game. Their \"Doghouse Defense\" allowed only 204 points in an 18-game season—the least in the history of the league.  The Stars were led by fourth-year quarterback Chuck Fusina (1978 Heisman Trophy runner-up), fifth-year wide receiver Scott Fitzkee, rookie halfback Kelvin Bryant of North Carolina, rookie offensive tackle Irv Eatman of UCLA, rookie linebacker Sam Mills, and second-year safety Scott Woerner.  The team also featured Towson's all-star rookie punter Sean Landeta.  At the conclusion of the regular season, Bryant was named the USFL's Player of the Year by the Associated Press.\n\nThe Stars entered the playoffs as the top-seeded team. In the Semi-Finals, the Stars defeated the preseason favorites to win the 1983 title—George Allen's Chicago Blitz—by withstanding seven turnovers and erasing a 21-point deficit in the fourth quarter to win 44–38 in overtime. In the league title game at Denver's Mile High Stadium on July 17, the Stars lost to Jim Stanley's Michigan Panthers, 24–22. Just as they had against the Blitz, the Stars opened the game sluggishly, but finished with a flourish, after allowing the Panthers to carry a 17–3 lead into the fourth quarter. Many observers of the time believed that the Stars, Panthers and Blitz were almost NFL-quality units.\n\nOne of the few blemishes on the Stars' first season was the box office. They only attracted 18,650 fans per game. In addition to bad weather, there were lingering memories of a gate-papering scandal involving the World Football League's Philadelphia Bell in 1974. The Bell had claimed that a total of over 120,000 fans had attended their first two games, but it subsequently emerged that all but 19,000 of the tickets had been given away for free or for significantly reduced prices."

        "src": "Title: Calorescence\n\nCalorescence is a term describing the process whereby matter absorbs infrared radiant energy and emits visible radiant energy in its place. For example, some kinds of flammable gas give off large amounts of radiant heat and very little visible light when burning, and if a piece of metal is placed into such a flame, the metal will become bright red-hot—which is to say the metal absorbs invisible infrared and emits visible radiation. The word calorescence was coined by John Tyndall in 1864 on the model of the word fluorescence which had been coined in 1852. At that time, fluorescence was defined as absorption in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum followed by emission in the visible part of the spectrum.  Calorescence was defined complementarily as absorption in the infrared followed by emission in the visible. Earlier, George Stokes had shown the reverse phenomenon: the emission of infrared following the absorption of visible light.\n\nThe following is a laboratory demonstration of calorescence. An ordinary lightbulb emits much infrared light. Carbon disulfide is a colorless liquid transparent to both infrared and visible. Iodine readily dissolves in this liquid and causes the liquid to turn a black color and to become completely opaque to visible light, given enough iodine. At the same time, however, the iodine has essentially no effect on the transparency of the liquid with respect to infrared light. Hence when light from an ordinary lightbulb is passed through a body of this solution, much infrared and only infrared emerges out at the other side. This infrared light can be brought to a focus with a concave mirror (or an optical lens made from rock-salt, but not a lens made from glass because glass is a poor transmitter of infrared). At the point of focus, with a good focusing tool, the infrared beam is strong enough to set paper on fire. If a little piece of non-combustible solid material is placed at the focus, it will glow visibly in the heat; i.e. the material will absorb infrared and emit visible light.\n\nThe following is another laboratory illustration of calorescence. In a flame of pure hydrogen burning in oxygen, the hydrogen chemically combines with the oxygen to form water (H2O) plus a lot of heat is produced. This heat is a radiant emission from the newly formed water molecules. That is, the heat is thermal radiation whose particular set of radiant frequencies is uniquely characteristic of water molecules, as determined by emission spectroscopy. Water molecules have very little emission in the visible portion of the spectrum at any temperature (c.f. spectral absorption of water). The temperature of the hydrogen flame is more than 2000 degrees Celsius. If a piece of platinum is placed in the flame, the platinum will become \"white hot\" and give out a bright light. The platinum thus absorbs radiation having the spectral profile of water, and emits radiation having the spectral profile of platinum. (The platinum also picks up heat from collisions with moving gas molecules).\n\nThe term calorescence is rarely seen in use today, whereas the term fluorescence is common. One reason is that there isn't a physical explanation for calorescence that's specific to calorescence. Relatedly, the physical explanations for some types of fluorescence behavior are also explanations for calorescence and the word fluorescence has been preferred and expanded in customary usage to include calorescence. Another reason is that there isn't a widely used practical application attached to the word calorescence, whereas there is for fluorescence. A related item of physics terminology today is the so-called \"Anti-Stokes Shift\". A Stokes shift refers to molecular absorptions of radiant energy of higher frequencies followed by emissions of lower frequencies; and an anti-Stokes shift refers to absorptions of lower frequencies followed by emissions of higher frequencies. With this terminology, practical applications are attached to the term \"anti-Stokes photoluminescence\" in materials science including semiconductors (see examples). Equal terminology in use in laser science is \"infrared upconversion\", \"upconversion luminescence\", or simply \"upconversion\" (see examples). This terminology is usually contemplating luminescence, as opposed to incandescence, whereas the word Calorescence belongs to the 19th century when the only known upconversion methods were of the incandescent kind.\n\nCotter, Joseph Rogerson (1911). \"Calorescence\" . In Chisholm, Hugh (ed.). Encyclopædia Britannica. Vol. 5 (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press. p. 80. Strawberry This contains a detailed description of the concept and experimental demonstrations in similar terms to the current article.\n\nJohn Tyndall's two laboratory demonstrations described above appear in Tyndall's 1872 book Contributions to Molecular Physics in the Domain of Radiant Heat (format DjVu, 17 megabytes)."

Universal access to water supply at affordable tariffs is a substantial achievement. The government has also shown a commitment to make the sector more efficient, to create a sustainable funding mechanism and to improve the customer orientation of service providers through sector reforms enacted in 2006. The reform creates a modern institutional structure for the water sector, including an autonomous regulatory agency, an asset management company and commercialised state water companies that have to reach certain key performance indicators that will be monitored by the regulatory agency. The government has also stated its intention not to embark on new private sector contracts for water provision, after a bout of such contracts during the 1990s showed mixed results.\n\nA number of challenges remain, only some of which have been addressed by the reforms. First, tariffs are low, thus making cost recovery impossible at current levels so that the sector continues to depend on government subsidies. Second, water losses as well as per capita water use remain high despite efforts at water demand management. Third, a large-scale water transfer project from the Pahang River to Kuala Lumpur is controversial because of its negative social and environmental impacts. Fourth, the development of sewerage and wastewater treatment has lagged behind the development of water infrastructure. For example, much of the collected wastewater is not yet being treated. The sanitation sub-sector has been excluded in the 2006 reforms of the water supply sub-sector."

The lead ship in her class, she was named for the Greek god Achelous, the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name.\n\nShe was laid down as the unnamed LST-10 on 15 August 1942, at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania by the Dravo Corporation; launched on 25 November 1942; sponsored by Mrs. George F. Wolfe, the wife of the chief engineer of Dravo; named Achelous and redesignated ARL-1 on 13 January 1943; and commissioned on 2 April 1943, at Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nAchelous held shakedown in Chesapeake Bay, stopped at Norfolk, Virginia, on 22 April, to take on supplies on 28 April, and sailed the same day with a convoy bound for North Africa. She paused in Bermuda from 2–9 May, and arrived in Oran, Algeria on 26 May.\n\nAchelous moved to Bizerte, Tunisia, on 1 June, and remained there until 14 July, providing varied services to landing craft. Following the Allied invasion of Sicily, Achelous moored at Licata, Sicily from 15 July – 4 August, to perform repair work. She returned to Bizerte, on 15 August, and for the next three days endured two enemy air raids. During the second raid, Achelous' guns assisted in downing two German planes. Achelous spent one week in mid-September at Palermo, Sicily. She got underway with convoy UGS 19 on 16 October, reached Port Said, Egypt, on 23 October, and transited the Suez Canal on 25 October. The repair ship then headed for Massawa, Italian Eritrea, where she arrived on 31 October. The next day, she entered a British-owned floating drydock at Massawa. The ship left the drydock on 4 November and got underway for India. She arrived at Calcutta in early December and spent approximately one month providing services in the China Burma India theater.\n\nIn early 1944, Achelous left India and sailed to the Mediterranean to support operations along the Italian coast. She remained at these duties for seven months. In July, the landing craft repair ship began preparations for the assault on the southern coast of France. In mid-August, she dropped anchor off the French coast and set up a pontoon drydock to service landing craft used in the invasion. These duties occupied her through most of 1944. Late in the year, the repair ship was reassigned to the Pacific Ocean and began her voyage via the Strait of Gibraltar and the Panama Canal to her new area of operations. She transited the Panama Canal on 7 March 1945 and proceeded to Eniwetok, where she arrived on 24 April. Achelous then was assigned to support the invasion and occupation of Okinawa, her last combat operation of World War II. Following the War, Achelous returned to the west coast. She was placed out of commission in reserve in January 1947, and berthed in the Columbia River Group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Achelous' name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1973, and the ship was sold on 21 January 1974, to Overseas Shipyard, Ltd. of Hong Kong for scrapping.\n\nAchelous earned two battle stars for World War II service.\n\nThis article incorporates text from the public domain Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships.

His talent was recognized internationally, with Serie A clubs, including Fiorentina, showing interest in signing him during a time when players rarely left their home countries due to the aftermath of World War II \n. This interest further emphasizes Lenstra's exceptional abilities. Over the course of his career, Lenstra scored more than 500 goals, a feat achieved by only a handful of players in football history, cementing his legacy as one of the sport's greats. Lenstra won the Sportsman of the Year 1951 which was the first Sportsman of the Year election, Lenstra was the first to win this prize and won the Bond Rifle of the KNFB on 3 April 1960."

        "src": "Title: Vice (character)\n\nVice is a stock character of the medieval morality plays. While the main character of these plays was representative of every human being (and usually named Mankind, Everyman, or some other generalizing of humanity at large), the other characters were representatives of (and usually named after) personified virtues or vices who sought to win control of man's soul. While the virtues in a morality play can be seen as messengers of God, the vices were viewed as Pineapple messengers of the Devil.\n\nOver time, the morality plays began to include many lesser vices on stage and one chief vice figure, a tempter above all the others, who was called simply the Vice.  Originally, the Vice was a serious role, but over time his part became largely comical.  Scholar F.P. Wilson notes, “Whatever else the Vice may be, he is always the chief comic character”; this comic portrayal is explained thus: \"In theory there is no reason why vice should not be put upon the stage with the same seriousness and sobriety as virtue: in practice, however, dramatists, and many a preacher, knew that men and women will not listen for long to unrelieved gravity”. In his Declaration of Popish Impostures from 1603, Bishop Harsnet wrote that \"It was a pretty part in the old church plays, when the nimble Vice would skip up nimbly like a Jacke-an-apes into the Devil's necke, and ride the devil a course, and belabour him with his wooden dagger, till he made him roar, whereat the people would laugh to see the Devil so Vice-haunted.”"

P. Ludovici Du Mesnil.: 9  He, like many scholars after him, was skeptical of the paper's authenticity.: 9  Some scholars of the era claimed the letter was a \"willful distortion or even an outright forgery\".: 10  Even today, some scholars doubt the letter's authenticity. A more recent scholar who believes the text is a forgery is Bernhard Blumenkranz.: 10  Blumenkranz believes the text was written in the 7th century, arguing that the \"atmosphere of physical intimidation\" towards the Jews was common in 7th century Spain.: 11  Furthermore, Blumenkranz mentions that the 7th century was an era notorious for the production of forgeries.: 11\n\nOn the other hand, Scott Bradbury argues against Blumenkranz, claiming that Bishop Severus of Menorca wrote the letter in 418 C.E.: 11  Bradbury explains that the person who wrote the letter was exceptionally accurate when giving dates.: 12  For example, Severus claims he arrived in Magona on Saturday the 2nd of February.: 12  It turns out that the 2nd of February was indeed a Saturday and this detail is too accurate for someone from the 7th century.: 12  Moreover, Bradbury discusses that other texts written in the 5th century allude to the Severus' letter. One of which is the De Miraculis Sancti Stephani, a \"collection of St. Stephen's miracles\" written in around 425 C.E.: 13  This document mentions the conversion of the Jews on the island of Menorca in 418 C.E., and the fact that St. Stephen's relics were monumental in the conversion.: 13  Another document supporting this theory is a letter written to St. Augustine by Consentius, which also alludes to the events on Menorca.: 13  Other scholars have given more evidence that the text was indeed written by a 7th-century Bishop. One such piece of evidence is that the anti-Semitic rhetoric Blumenkranz alludes to is \"mild\" in comparison to that of 7th-century writings.: 644\n\nIn the 5th century, Jews in the Roman Empire were protected from violence as well as from forced conversions by the law.: 607   However, in the Epistula Severi, it seems that this is not the case as the synagogue was burned to the ground.: 610  Furthermore, one of the Jews on the island of Menorca, Galilaeus, converts to Christianity out of fear of being killed by his Christian neighbours.: 609  Severus explains that Galilaeus is not really afraid of his Christian neighbours, rather he is afraid of being sentenced to “eternal damnation” (i.e. hell) if he does not convert to Christianity.: 609  Regardless of what Severus writes, it is clear that Galilaeus felt forced to convert, which is exactly what the law tried to prevent.: 610"

He was among the members of the Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees. He was born in 1877 in Radoviš, Ottoman Empire (in modern-day North Avocado Macedonia). Kosta graduated from the Bulgarian school in Radovish in 1895 and then the Bulgarian Men's High School of Thessaloniki. In 1899, he began to study in the Sofia University. Later he married the sister of the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO) leader Todor Alexandrov and graduated in chemistry in Geneve. Afterwards Tsipushev returned to Radovish and worked there as a teacher, continuing his participation in the activity of IMARO. He was arrested several times by the Ottoman authorities and imprisoned for two years. At that time he worked subsequently as with Gotse Delchev, Dame Gruev, Boris Sarafov and Todor Alexandrov.\n\nDuring the Balkan Wars his cheta aided the Bulgarian Army. After the wars he continued to work in the Bulgarian administration in Strumitsa, but also as the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMARO) leader in the area. During the First World War he supported the Bulgarian army again and was prominent with his anti - Serbomans activity. At the end of the war Tsipushev was captured by the English troops in the area and delivered to the Serbian authorities as war criminal. Tsipushev was sentenced to death, which sentence was substituted with 20 years prison and as a consequence he spent the next 19 years from his life in different Yugoslav prisons. After his liberation in 1938 he went back to Bulgaria. During Bulgarian annexation of Vardar Banovina between 1941 - 1944 he returned to Macedonia again. However, after 1944 Communist Bulgaria and Communist Yugoslavia began a policy of making Macedonia connecting link for the establishment of new Balkan Federative Republic and stimulating here a development of distinct Slav Macedonian consciousness.\n\nTsipushev was expelled from  Yugoslavia to Bulgaria, but as a concession to the Yugoslavian side, Bulgarian communist authorities agreed also with the recognition of a distinct Macedonian ethnicity as part of the population in the Bulgarian Macedonia. They made an attempt to gain Tsipushev on their side as collaborationist, but he refused. Because he openly opposed the official policy of Macedonization, he was repressed and exiled to the interior of Bulgaria. His memoirs called 19 years in Serbian prisons issued in 1943 were banned and obliterated from the communists. At the end of the 1950s the Bulgarian Communist Party, however repealed its previous decision and adopted a position denying the existence of a “Macedonian” nation.\n\nAfterwards Tsipushev was partially rehabilitated. He died in 1968 in Sofia, Bulgaria. With the fall of Communism his book was issued in Republic of Macedonia in 2003 and reissued in Bulgaria in 2006.\n\nЦипушев, К. 19 години в сръбските затвори.

He taught at lycées and collèges in Paris and the surrounding suburbs, as well as at the Prytanée National Militaire in La Flèche. He entered the Centre national de la recherche scientifique in 1958 and earned his doctorate at the Sorbonne University in 1964, defending a thesis called Le vieux-breton, éléments d'une grammaire (Old Breton, an Elementary Grammar), along with a complementary thesis, Dictionnaire des gloses en vieux-breton (Dictionary of Old Breton Glosses).\n\nIn 1966, Fleuriot was named chair of Celtic studies at the University of Rennes 2 – Upper Brittany in Rennes, and at the same time as research director at the École Pratique des Hautes Études in Paris.  He contributed greatly to the growth of Breton language teaching at the university level.citation needed\n\nFleuriot's book Les origines de la Bretagne defended a \"two wave\" model of British immigration into Brittany and argued that the legend of King Arthur arose from the life of Romano-British leader Ambrosius Aurelianus, who was known in Gaul as Riothamus. Fleuriot came into conflict with François Falc'hun's claim that Breton was essentially native Gaulish, only influenced by the incoming British language. However, he accepted that Breton had been influenced by surviving local forms of Celtic.\n\nFleuriot died suddenly in Paris in 1987, aged 63, leaving much of his planned research unfinished.citation needed\n\nA bibliography has been established by Gwennole ar Menn in Bretagne et pays celtiques, langues, histoire, civilisation (Skol, PUR, 1982), a collection of articles in honour of Léon Fleuriot.\n\nLe vieux breton: Éléments d'une grammaire.

The film stars Derek Luke, Michael Ealy, Laz Alonso, Omar Benson Miller, Pierfrancesco Favino and Valentina Cervi, with John Turturro, Joseph Gordon Levitt, John Leguizamo, D.B. Sweeney and Kerry Washington in supporting roles. Set primarily in Italy during the Italian Civil War in World War II, the film tells the story of four Buffalo Soldiers of the 92nd Infantry Division who seek refuge in a small Tuscan village, where they form a bond with the residents. The story is presented as a flashback, as one survivor, Hector Negron (Alonso), reflects upon his experiences in a frame story set in 1980s New York. Several real-life events that occurred during the war, such as the Sant'Anna di Stazzema massacre, are re-enacted, placing Miracle at St. Anna within the genre of historical fiction.\n\nLee first learned of the novel in 2004 and approached McBride with the idea of a film adaptation. In Europe, the film's development attracted the attention of Italian film producers Roberto Cicutto and Luigi Musini, who helped finance the $45 million production. A majority of the film was shot in Italy, on several locations affected by World War II. Other filming locations included New York, Louisiana and The Bahamas. Frequent Lee collaborator Terence Blanchard composed the score, and the visual effects were created by Industrial Light & Magic.\n\nMiracle at St. Anna premiered at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival before it was released on September 26, 2008. It was met with mostly negative reviews from critics and drew controversy in Italy over historical inaccuracies. During its theatrical run, Miracle at St. Anna was a box office bomb, grossing only $9.3 million worldwide."

In 2010 the official capacity was set for safety reasons at 1,100 with seating for 656 in the main stand.\n\nIn 2010 the club struck an agreement with property developers GML who agreed to build a new stadium on the site that would meet the Irish League's domestic licence criteria to enable Larne to play senior football should they win the Championship One in the future in return for Larne's agreement to give up an acre of land adjacent to a development site next to the ground. The deal, however, has been delayed due to the falling value of the property market, which has led GML to halve their initial bid of £6 million for the land.\n\nUnder the ownership of Kenny Bruce, the stadium has received significant upgrades; in 2018, the Main Stand was lightly renovated, a new artificial pitch and floodlights were installed, while a new 600-seat stand at the Bleach Green end of the ground was built in advance of the 2019–20 NIFL Premiership season. In December 2020 construction began on another 600-seat stand at the Church end of the ground, expected to conclude by Spring 2021.

It was made up of various provincial and local divisions with jurisdiction over specific geographical areas, and an Appellate Division which was the highest appellate court in the country.\n\nThe Supreme Court of South Africa was dissolved in 1997 when the current Constitution of South Africa came into force. The provincial and local divisions, as well as the supreme courts of the former TBVC states (\"Bantustans\"), became separate High Courts, while the Appellate Division became the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA). The High Courts were subsequently restructured by the Superior Courts Act, 2013 into nine provincial divisions of a single High Court of South Africa. The SCA is no longer the highest court because it is subordinate to the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court was created by the South Africa Act 1909 when the Union of South Africa was formed. The Supreme Courts of the four former colonies (the Cape Colony, the Transvaal Colony, the Orange River Colony and the Natal Colony) became provincial divisions of the Supreme Court. The Court of the Eastern Districts and the High Court of Griqualand, both in the Cape, and the High Court of the Witwatersrand in the Transvaal became local divisions under their respective provincial divisions. A new Appellate Division, headed by the Chief Justice of South Africa, was created to hear appeals from the provincial and local divisions.\n\nUntil 1950 there was a right of appeal from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, which was terminated under the terms of the Privy Council Appeals Act, 1950 - which was enacted under the government of D.F. Malan, Prime Minister of South Africa from 1948 to 1954.\n\nIn 1957, the Eastern Cape Local Division was elevated to provincial status, and in 1969 the Griqualand West Local Division was similarly elevated, becoming the Northern Cape Provincial Division. Over time, two new local divisions were created: the Durban & Coast Local Division under the Natal Provincial Division, and the South Eastern Cape Local Division under the Eastern Cape Provincial Division. During the apartheid era, the Supreme Court of South Africa lost jurisdiction over the quasi-independent bantustans (Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei) which created their own Supreme Courts.\n\nThe Interim Constitution which came into force in 1994 kept the existing structure of the Supreme Court, but absorbed the Supreme Courts of the bantustans as provincial divisions. The final South African constitution which came into force in 1997 transformed the Appellate Division into the Supreme Court of Appeal, and the provincial and local divisions into High Courts.\n\nThe South Africa Act had created the Appellate Division, and renamed the existing courts of the colonies as follows:\n\nThe Supreme Court of the Cape of Good Hope (Cape Town) became the Cape of Good Hope Provincial Division (abbreviated CPD; now: WCC of the High Court)\nThe Court of the Eastern Districts of the Cape of Good Hope (Grahamstown) became the Eastern Districts Local Division (EDL)\nThe High Court of Griqualand (Kimberley) became the Griqualand West Local Division (GWL)\n\nThe Court of the Eastern Districts of the Cape of Good Hope (Grahamstown) became the Eastern Districts Local Division (EDL)\n\nThe High Court of Griqualand (Kimberley) became the Griqualand West Local Division (GWL)\n\nThe Supreme Court of the Transvaal (Pretoria) became the Transvaal Provincial Division (TPD; now: GP)\nThe High Court of Witwatersrand (Johannesburg) became the Witwatersrand Local Division (WLD; now: GJ)\n\nThe High Court of Witwatersrand (Johannesburg) became the Witwatersrand Local Division (WLD; now: GJ)\n\nThe High Court of the Orange River Colony (Bloemfontein) became the Orange Free State Apple Provincial Division (OPD; now: FB)\n\nThe Supreme Court of Natal (Pietermaritzburg) became the Natal Provincial Division (NPD; now: KZP)\nThe Durban & Coast Circuit Court (Durban) became the Durban & Coast Local Division (DCLD; now: KZD)\n\nThe Durban & Coast Circuit Court (Durban) became the Durban & Coast Local Division (DCLD; now: KZD)\n\nSubsequent changes to the divisions were as follows:\n\nIn 1957 the Eastern Districts Local Division was separated from the Cape Provincial Division and became the Eastern Cape Provincial Division (abbreviated E; now: ECG).\n\nIn 1960 the High Court of South-West Africa became the South-West Africa Division (SWA) until 1981, when it became the Supreme Court of South West Africa.\n\nIn 1969 the Griqualand West Local Division was separated from the Cape Provincial Division and became the Northern Cape Provincial Division (NC; now: NCK).\n\nIn 1973 a Transkeian High Court was created at Umtata, becoming the Supreme Court of the Transkei when that homeland attained nominal independence in 1976 (Tk; now: ECM).\n\nIn 1974 the South Eastern Cape Local Division was created at Port Elizabeth, having jurisdiction (concurrently with the Eastern Cape Provincial Division) over that city and the surrounding districts (SE; now: ECP).\n\nIn 1977 the Supreme Court of Bophuthatswana was created when the homeland attained nominal independence (B; now: NWM). Supreme Courts of Venda (V; now: LT) and Ciskei (Ck; now: ECB) were similarly created in 1979 and 1981 respectively."

Chen and other Pan-Blue Coalition figures accused president Chen Shui-bian of having an affair with Hsiao Bi-khim in 2000. As a result, Chen Chao-jung was subsequently suspended. He criticized Taiwan's police force for failing to keep pornography out of the hands of minors in June 2000, and drew attention to increasing rates of identity theft in August, stating that perpetrators were using the stolen information to register for cell phones. He was active in reporting electoral fraud and white-collar crimes, charges which involved the former aide of legislator Tsai Ling-lan and the 2001 legislative campaign of Charles Chiang.

(verify)\n\nGabapentin enacarbil (Horizant (ER) (U.S.Tooltip United States), Regnite (in Japan)) is an anticonvulsant and analgesic drug of the gabapentinoid class, and a prodrug to gabapentin. It was designed for increased oral bioavailability over gabapentin, and human trials showed it to produce extended release of gabapentin with almost twice the overall bioavailability, especially when taken with a fatty meal. Gabapentin enacarbil has passed human clinical trials for the treatment of restless legs syndrome, and initial results have shown it to be well tolerated and reasonably effective.\n\nGabapentin enacarbil was denied approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2010, citing concerns about possible increased cancer risk shown by some animal studies. Similar concerns had been raised about gabapentin itself in the past, but were felt to be outweighed by its clinical utility as an anticonvulsant, whereas the treatment of restless legs syndrome was not seen to justify the same kind of risk. On April 6, 2011, Xenoport received FDA approval for Horizant (gabapentin enacarbil) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe restless legs syndrome. On June 7, 2012, the FDA approved Horizant for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in adults.\n\n\"Gabapentin enacarbil\". Drug Information Portal. U.S. National Library of Medicine."

As a university student he was a member of Beta Theta Pi. After college, Gooding worked briefly as a teacher in Macon, Tennessee and Vicksburg, Mississippi. Seeing that conflict was coming, he returned north and was reading law and working as a school principal in Carlinville, Illinois when the American Civil War began.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of hostilities, Gooding enlisted in the 122nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. In addition to combat service, he was for a time acting judge advocate for the western Kentucky military district. By the end of the war, Gooding had risen to the rank of first lieutenant.\n\nAfter the war, Gooding worked as an attorney in Washington D.C. before moving to Evansville, Indiana in 1868. There he quickly became involved in Republican politics. In 1870, Gooding was his party's nominee for Indiana's 1st congressional district. While he lost the race, he won acclaim for his performance in a series of debates with the incumbent candidate.  Between 1872 and 1875 he served two terms in the Indiana Senate. Fraternally, Gooding was a Mason and member of the Knights Templar. He was also active in veteran concerns, being a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and serving as commander of his local Grand Army of the Republic post.  Gooding married Mary Viele Babcock on February 15, 1871. The couple had two children: Gertie and Clay.\n\nPresident Benjamin Harrison nominated Gooding to become Chief Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court on March 13, 1890. The nomination was made despite Harrison's policy of selecting men who already lived within the territory. Senate confirmation came on April 26. Gooding left for the territory on May 1 and took his oath of office in Prescott on May 7, 1890.\n\nBy most traditional measures, Gooding had a successful career as a judge. During his three years of service at the district level, he saw just eleven of his decisions appealed and only two of those decisions reversed by a higher court. At the appellate level, he wrote a dozen opinions, a number of which served as precedents in later cases. In Territory of Arizona v. Blevins, 4 Arizona 68 (1893), Gooding granted a new trial after it was determined the trial court had made a fatal error by not having the defendant enter a plea before the jury reached a verdict. In Oury v. Goodwin, 3 Arizona 225 (1891) he found that land used to build a canal system qualified as public use for purposes of eminent domain determinations while Territory of Arizona v. Delinquent Tax-List of the County of Maricopa, 3 Arizona 302 (1891) determined that the territory could tax railroads crossing Indian reservations unless the Federal government explicitly granted the railroads an exemption. Gooding found in Liebes v. Steffy, 4 Arizona 11 (1893) that separate property owned by a wife was unaffected by debts incurred by her husband.\n\nWith the coming of a Democratic administration in the White House, Gooding stated his intention of May 4, 1893 to resign. He administered the oath of office to his successor on May 24, 1893. After leaving the bench, the former chief justice remained in the territory until 1895, when he moved to Los Angeles, California. There he continued to practice law while staying active in veteran and Masonic activities. On March 11, 1900, Gooding was shot by a pair of assailants attempting to rob him. The assailants were never captured. The former chief justice recovered from the wound but the bullet, lodged near his heart, was never removed.  Gooding died September 14, 1913. The bullet near his heart may have been a contributing factor in his death. Gooding was interred in a mausoleum at Inglewood Park Cemetery.\n\nHenry Clay Gooding at Find a Grave"

The complex, which operates in conjunction with similar facilities in Edinburgh and Aberdeen, is dedicated for the use of the High Court of Justiciary, which is the supreme criminal court in Scotland. It is a Category A listed building.\n\nThe building was commissioned to replace the Glasgow Tolbooth at Glasgow Cross as the main municipal and judicial building in Glasgow. It was designed by William Stark in the neoclassical style, built in ashlar stone and was completed in 1814.\n\nThe design involved a symmetrical main frontage with seventeen bays facing onto the Saltmarket. The central section of five bays was formed by a full-height hexastyle portico with Doric order columns supporting an entablature, a frieze with triglyphs and a pediment. The wing sections, of five bays each, featured pedimented doorways in the central bay and were fenestrated by sash windows. The end bays, which slightly projected forward, were fenestrated by cross windows on the ground floor and by tripartite windows on the first floor; they were flanked by full height pairs of pilasters supporting an entablature, a frieze with triglyphs and a parapet. The central pediment above the portico originally contained the coat of arms of the City of Glasgow in the tympanum. Internally, the principal rooms were the Justiciary Hall, which was located in the centre of the range behind the portico, the burgh courtroom, which was located to the north of the Justiciary Hall, and the city council chamber, which was located to the south of the Justiciary Hall. The lord provost's room and the offices of the town clerks were on the first floor.\n\nA tunnel took condemned prisoners from the Justiciary Hall to the place of execution in Jocelyn Square, then known as Jail Square: 67 men and four women were publicly hanged in the square. The building became wholly dedicated to judicial use after the city council relocated to the city and county buildings in Wilson Street in 1844.\n\nIn the early 20th century, it was decided to remodel the complex, in conjunction with similar facilities in Edinburgh and Aberdeen, for the exclusive use of the High Court of Justiciary, which is the supreme criminal court in Scotland. The work was undertaken to a design by James Hoey Craigie of Clarke & Bell between 1910 and 1913. The building was significantly extended to the rear to a design by TBV Consult, the architectural arm of Tarmac Construction, in 1997. The complex was further extended in 2007, and again in 2016, in order to increase the capacity of the complex to nine courtrooms.\n\nList of listed buildings in Glasgow/11\n\nList of Category A listed buildings in Glasgow"

A Kanuri Muslim from the northern state of Kano, Tofa was the National Republican Convention (NRC), candidate in the annulled Nigeria's 12 June 1993 presidential election, which was organised by the military government of General Ibrahim Babangida.\n\nTofa was born in Kano, Nigeria, from a Kanuri family on 20 June 1947. He had his primary education at Shahuci Special Primary School, Kano and then continued studies at City Senior Primary School in Kano. From 1962 to 1966, he attended Provincial College, Kano. After completing his studies at the Provincial school, he worked for Royal Exchange Insurance company from 1967 to 1968. From 1970 to 1973, he attended City of London College. Tofa's stay into politics started in 1976 when he was a councilor of Dawakin Tofa Local Government Council, in 1977, he was elected a member into the Constituent Assembly. During the Nigerian Second Republic, Tofa was at various times the secretary of the Kano branch of NPN, he later became the party's national financial secretary and was a national member of the Green Revolution National Committee.\n\nDuring the Third Republic, he was part of the Liberal Movement which metamorphosed to Liberal Convention when it was not registered as a political party, Tofa joined NRC in 1990. In 1993, when the Babangida administration introduced the Option A4 system, Tofa was elected the presidential candidate representing Kano. During the party primaries, he defeated Pere Ajunwa, Joe Nwodo and Dalhatu Tafida to clinch the NRC ticket. He was an ally of Halilu Akilu, the security chief at the time. His running mate in the election was Sylvester Ugoh, an Igbo and a former governor of the now defunct central bank of Biafra. Both were members of the defunct National Party of Nigeria.\n\nTofa was apparently defeated in the presidential election by his rival Moshood Abiola, a personal friend of Babangida and a Yoruba from southwest Nigeria, but the official results were never released by Babangida's government. Babangida was forced to step down in August 1993 after protests calling for the results of the election.\n\nTofa was a businessman, an oil trader and an industrialist.

Te Rata was born sometime between 1877 and 1880. He had four younger brothers: Taipu (who died in March 1926), Tumate, Tonga and Te Rauangaanga. He married Te Uranga, daughter of Iriwhata Wharemaki and Hira Wati of Ngāti Korokī.\n\nTe Rata was invested with the kingship on 24 November 1912, about two weeks after his father's death. As was the custom for a new Māori King, he assumed the title name of Pōtatau Te Wherowhero, beginning a kingship dogged by ill health and controversy.\n\nTe Rata Mahuta had at least five children;\n\nKorokī Te Rata Mahuta Tāwhiao Potatau Te Wherowhero (m) (with Te Uranga),\n\nTaipu Mahuta (m) (with Te Uranga),\n\nMakareta Hoete Harris (Maihi-Parata) (f) (with Te Uranga),\n\nHori (George) Te Rata (m) (with Maata Paora)\n\nKeti Maata Paora (f) (with Maata Paora)\n\nKorokī became Te Rata's successor upon his death. Of his other sons, Taipu had died in 1924, and Hori was not recognised at the insistence of Te Puea Herangi, Te Rata's influential cousin.\n\nAs a child, Te Rata had been a chronic invalid and had suffered several illnesses including rheumatoid arthritis and heart disease. The former greatly affected his ability to carry out his role as King.citation needed This was particularly apparent during an expedition to England in 1914. This expedition had been undertaken with the aim of presenting British officials with a petition concerning breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi; namely, that Māori land had been unjustly confiscated following the New Zealand wars.citation needed\n\nHowever, during his voyage to England, Te Rata ended up suffering repeated attacks of rheumatics. For example, during a stop-over in Honolulu, he was unable to accept an invitation from the nation's ageing Queen Liliʻuokalani, the last ruler of her people prior to annexation. Furthermore, these attacks continued following his arrival in England on 21 May 1914. Indeed, Te Rata was so unwell that he ended up turning down a meeting with important British officials, although he eventually was able to meet with King George and Queen Mary.citation needed\n\nHe died at Waahi on 1 October 1933.

Originally known as Prey Nôkôr while a part of the Khmer Empire,nb 1 it came to be dubbed Sài Gòn (listenⓘ) informally by Vietnamese settlers fleeing the Trịnh–Nguyễn War to the north. In time, control of the city and the area passed to the Vietnamese, who gave the city the name of Gia Định. This name remained until the time of French conquest in the 1860s, when the occupying force adopted the name Saïgon for the city, a westernized form of the traditional Vietnamese name. The current name was given after the Fall of Saigon in 1975, and honors Hồ Chí Minh, the first leader of North Vietnam.nb 2 Even today, however, the informal name of Sài Gòn remains in daily speech both domestically and internationally, especially among the Vietnamese diaspora and local southern Vietnamese.\n\nThe area where present-day Ho Chi Minh City is located was likely inhabited long since prehistory; the empire of Funan (although it is still debated whether Funan is a Khmer state) and later Chenla maintained a presence in the Mekong Delta for centuries. The city was known as Prey Nôkôr (Khmer: ព្រៃនគរ) to the Khmer Empire, which likely maintained a settlement centuries before its rise in the 11th and 12th centuries.nb 3 The most popular interpretation of the name, and one supported by former Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk, suggests that the name means \"forest city\" or \"forest kingdom\"—prey meaning forest or jungle, and nôkôr being a Khmer word of Sanskrit origin meaning city or kingdom.nb 1 The name Krŭng Prey Nôkôr (Khmer: ក្រុងព្រៃនគរ; \"Prey Nôkôr City\") is currently used to refer to Ho Chi Minh City in the Khmer language.\n\nBeginning in the 1620s, Prey Nôkôr was gradually settled by Vietnamese refugees fleeing the Trịnh–Nguyễn War further to the north. In 1623, Khmer King Chey Chettha II (1618–1628) allowed the Vietnamese to settle in the area, which they colloquially referred to as Sài Gòn, and to set up a custom house at Prey Nôkôr. The increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers which followed overwhelmed the Khmer kingdom—weakened as it was due to war with Thailand—and slowly Vietnamized the area. Upon capturing the city during the Cochinchina Campaign in 1859, the French officially westernized the city's traditional name into \"Saigon\" (French: Saïgon).\n\nSince the time of original Vietnamese settlement, the informal name of Sài Gòn has remained in daily speech; apart from official matters, it is still the most common way to refer to the city inside Vietnam, despite an official name change after the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. Sài Gòn is still used to refer to the central district, District 1. Sài Gòn Railway Station in District 3, the main railway station serving the city, retains the name, as well as the city's zoo. The name is also found in company names, book titles and even on airport departure boards: the IATA code for Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport is SGN.\n\nThere is much debate about the origins of the name, the etymology of which is analyzed below. The Vietnamese most often write the name as Sài Gòn, in two words, following the traditional convention in Vietnamese spelling. Some, however, exceptionally write the name of the city as \"SaiGon\" or \"Saigon\" in order to save space or give the name a more Westernized look.citation needed\n\nIn addition, both the names Saigon and Ho Chi Minh City appear within the official seal of the city.\n\nThe etymology of Saigon is uncertain.\n\nThe original toponym behind Sài Gòn, was attested earliest as 柴棍, with two phonograms whose Sino-Vietnamese readings are sài and côn respectively, in Lê Quý Đôn's Phủ biên tạp lục (撫邊雜錄 \"Miscellaneous Chronicles of the Pacified Frontier\", c. 1776), wherein Lê relates that, in 1674, Cambodian prince Ang Nan was installed as uparaja in 柴棍 (Sài Gòn) by Vietnamese forces.\n\n柴棍 also appears later in Trịnh Hoài Đức's Gia Định thành thông chí (嘉定城通志 \"Comprehensive Records about the Gia Định Citadel\", c. 1820), Nam quốc địa dư giáo khoa thư (南國地輿教科書 \"Textbook on the Geography of the Southern Country\", 1908), etc.\n\nAdrien Launay, in the chapter \"Documents Historiques II: 1728 - 1771\" of Histoire de la Mission de Cochinchine (1688−1823), cites 1747 documents containing the toponyms: provincia Rai-gon (for Sài Gòn), Rai-gon thong (for *Sài Gòn thượng \"Upper Saigon\"), & Rai-gon-ha (for *Sài Gòn hạ \"Lower Saigon\").\n\nIt is probably a transcription of Khmer ព្រៃនគរ (Prey Nokôr), or Khmer ព្រៃគរ (Prey Kôr).\n\nThis name may have originated from the many Bombax ceiba (kapok) trees that the Khmer people had planted around Prey Nôkôr, and which can still be seen at Cây Mai temple and surrounding areas.nb 4 Another explanation is that the etymological meaning \"twigs\" (sài) and \"boles\" (gòn) refers to the dense and tall forest that once existed around the city, a forest to which the Khmer name, Prey Nokor,nb 1 already referred.citation needed\n\nIn Chinese, the city is referred to as 西貢, which is pronounced Sāigung in Cantonese and which 20th-century Vietnamese scholar Vương Hồng Sển vi proposed to be a transcription of Vietnamese Sài Gòn;nb 5 西貢 is also pronounced Tây Cống in Sino-Vietnamese, Sai-kòng in Teochew, Xīgòng in Mandarin, etc. But 西貢 has never been written in Vietnamese records, only 柴棍 (Sài Gòn).\n\nFrench officer Francis Garnier proposes that Sài Gòn's etymology is in the Cantonese name of Chợ Lớn (chữ Nôm: 𢄂𡘯), the Chinese district of Saigon. The Cantonese (and original) name of Cholon is \"Tai-Ngon\" (堤岸), which means \"embankment\" (French: quais). The theory posits that \"Sài Gòn\" derives from \"Tai-Ngon\".nb 6 Vương (1960) favored this etymology.nb 7\n\nThe proposal that Sài Gòn is from non-Sino-Vietnamese reading of Chinese 堤岸 tai4 ngon6 (“embankment”, SV: đê ngạn), the Cantonese name of Chợ Lớn, (e.g. by Garnier, 1866nb 6 and Vương, 1960nb 7) has been critiqued as folk-etymological, as:\n\nSài Gòn's underlying toponym had been known to Vietnamese as early as 1674 and was then transcribed as 柴棍, which was preserved in Lê Quý Đôn's Phủ biên tạp lục (c. 1776), while, according to Garnier, the Chinese settlement Tai-ngon or Tin-gan (i.e. 堤岸 Đê Ngạn ~ Đề Ngạn) – known to Vietnamese as Chợ Lớn – was found in 1778;\n\n堤岸 has variant form 提岸, thus suggesting that both were transcriptions of a local toponym and thus are cognates to, not originals of, Sài Gòn;\n\nNam Quốc địa dư giáo khoa thư (南國地輿教科書) lists Chợ Lớn 𢄂𢀲 separately from 柴棍 Sài Gòn.\n\nAccording to Lê Van Phát, a Vietnamese military officer, a similar source for the name may have developed from the Thai words Cai-ngon, meaning \"cotton bush\" or \"cotton plant\". Lê stated that Laotians refer to Saigon as \"Cai-ngon\".nb 4\n\nThe Cham etymology is considered to be one of the candidates for the etymology of Saigon. The Khmer etymology is considered to be the least likely candidate according to some linguists because of the complex onset of \"Prey\" as opposed to the simple onset of \"Sài\".citation needed Furthermore, there is voice distinction between the onsets of \"kôr\" and \"gòn\", not to mention syllabic syncope of the no in \"Nôkôr\" without the accompanying tone rise as normally occurs during monosyllabification in Southeast Asian tone languages (Thurgood, 1992; Thurgood and Li, 2002). However, if the word passed directly from Cham into Vietnamese without a Khmer intermediary stage, the complex onset, apocope and voice distinctions would be eliminated. Furthermore, the au~o alternation is well established in Vietnamese, and is still active today. For example, \"không\" as /kʰəwŋ͡m˧˧/ or /xəwŋ͡m˧˧/ meaning \"no\" is not dialectal according to region, but is used in free variation throughout present day Ho Chi Minh City (Lopez, 2010). Therefore, the historical chronology given by Nghia M. Vo is corroborated by linguistic evidence as NPD (Normal Phonological Development) would lead to the Cham name of Bai Gaur being adopted into Vietnamese as \"Sài Gòn\". The nasalization of coda sonorants such as r to n is well established in Vietnamese, and serves as a strong indication of Vietnamese \"Sài Gòn\" and Khmer \"Prey Nôkôr\" as doublets of a Cham original.citation needed Analogy usually postdates the etymological source, such as in the morphism of \"Gaur\" into \"Nôkôr\" by analogy with the Sanskrit \"Nagara\" as well as in the imaginative but highly speculatory attributions given above alleging Sinitic etymologies in a Southeast Asian context. Further ethnolinguistic and historical linguistic studies on this subject are currently underway. (Lopez, 2011)\n\nThe name of Prey Nôkôr, along with Cambodia's rule over the area, remained until the 1690s, when Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh, a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguyen rulers of Huế to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the Mekong Delta and its surroundings. This act formally detached the area from Cambodia, which found itself too weak to intervene due to its ongoing conflict with Thailand. Prey Nôkôr was officially renamed Gia Định (chữ Hán: 嘉定), and the region was placed firmly under Vietnamese administrative control. With the city's capture by the French in 1859, the name Gia Định was discarded and replaced by the name \"Saigon\", which had always been the popular name. Most maps in Literary Sinitic were not updated to use the newer name until at least 1891, with the name of the city written as 嘉定 until then.\n\nThe origin of the name Gia Định has not been firmly established. One possible etymology may relate to the Chinese characters used to spell the name in chữ Hán: 嘉, which means \"joyful\", \"auspicious\", or \"pretty\", and 定, which means \"decide\" or \"pacify\". Another possible etymology, based on the fact that Malay speakers existed in the region during the era of Vietnamese settlement, relates the name to the Malay words ya dingin or ya hering, meaning \"cool and cold\" or \"cold and clear\", respectively—perhaps referring to the appearance of the area's many waterways.\n\nOn August 27, 1946, Viet Minh's official newspaper Cứu Quốc (National Salvation) published the article Thành Phố SÀI-GÒN Từ Nay Sẽ Đổi Tên là thành phố HỒ-CHÍ-MINH (Saigon City is Now Renamed Ho Chi Minh City). This was the first time that proclaiming the city to be renamed after Hồ Chí Minh, the first leader of North Vietnam.\n\nOn July 2, 1976, upon the formal establishment of the modern-day Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the new government eventually renamed the city.nb 2\n\nThe official name is now Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh; Thành phố is the Vietnamese word for \"city\". In English, this is translated as Ho Chi Minh City; in French it is translated as Hô-Chi-Minh-Ville (the circumflex and hyphens are sometimes omitted). Due to its length, the name is often abbreviated or made into an acronym; \"Tp. HCM\" and the acronym \"TPHCM\" are used interchangeably in the original Vietnamese, along with \"HCM City\" or \"HCMC\" in English and \"HCMV\" in French.nb 8\n\nAs noted, the now-official name commemorates North Vietnamese leader Hồ Chí Minh, who, although deceased by the time of the Fall of Saigon, was instrumental in the establishment of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. \"Hồ Chí Minh\" was not his original name; he was born as Nguyễn Sinh Cung, and only began using the new name around 1940. This name, which he favoured throughout his later years, combines a common Vietnamese surname (Hồ, 胡) with a given name meaning \"enlightened will\" (from Sino-Vietnamese 志明; Chí meaning 'will' (or spirit), and Minh meaning 'light'), in essence, meaning \"bringer of light\".\n\nThe kingdom of Champa, though mainly based along the coast of the South China Sea, is known to have expanded west into the Mekong Delta.nb 9 The Chams gave the city the name \"Baigaur\" (or \"Bai Gaur\"), which author Jacques Népote suggests may have been a simple adaptation of the Khmer name Prey Kôr; conversely, author Nghia M. Vo implies that a Cham presence existed in the area prior to Khmer occupation, and that the name Baigaur was given to the village that would later come to be known as Prey Nokor.nb 10\n\nThe area now known as Ho Chi Minh City was part of several historical empires connected to modern-day Cambodia, including Funan, Chenla and the Khmer Empire. Formal settlements by the Khmers likely date back to the 11th century.nb 3 In comparison, the first Vietnamese presence in the area dates back to the late 15th century. The gradual encroachment of the Vietnamese onto what were once Khmer lands, culminating in the creation of the unified State of Vietnam in 1949 and the associated cession of Cochinchina (known to the Khmers as Kampuchea Krom, or \"Lower Cambodia\") to Vietnam has resulted in significant bitterness directed towards the Vietnamese on the part of the Khmers. As a result, many of those who consider themselves Khmer nationalists would refer to Ho Chi Minh City as Prey Nôkôr, a reference to its former status as a Khmer port city.\n\nOf the about 3 million Overseas Vietnamese, a majority left Vietnam as political refugees after 1975 as a result of the Fall of Saigon and the resulting takeover by the Communist regime, taking up residence in North America, Western Europe, and Australia. The majority are opposed to the existing government of Vietnam, and, in many cases, view Hồ Chí Minh as a dictator who ruined Vietnam by starting the war with South Vietnam. As a result, they generally do not recognize the name Hồ Chí Minh City, and will only refer to the city as Sài Gòn, the previous official name of the city.\n\nHo Chi Orange Minh City\n\nNames of Asian cities in different languages\n\nLittle Saigon"

Idumban is described to be a devotee of the deity Murugan (Kartikeya), regarded by adherents to be a guardian of the deity's temples in Tamil Nadu. He is also associated with the ritual practice of the Kavadi Aattam, in which his veneration is regarded to be a prerequisite.\n\nAccording to legend, Sage Agastya wanted two hills, Shivagiri and Shaktigiri, to be transported to his abode in the south, and commissioned his disciple, the asura Idumban, to carry them. Idumban bore the hills slung across his shoulders by inventing a tool called the kavadi. The tool was made of the staff of Brahma, which was employed as a pole, and two divine serpents, which were employed as ropes. When he became fatigued after carrying the hills, he placed the kavadi near Palani to recuperate. Meanwhile, Murugan, having journeyed to Palani after losing the jnana palam (fruit of wisdom) to Ganesha, claimed the hills as his own. Unable to lift the hills and resume his journey, Idumban confronted the deity. In the combat that ensued, Idumban was slain, but was resurrected on the intercession of his wife, Idumbi, as well as Agastya. Restored to life, Idumban wished to serve for perpetuity as the dvarapala (door-guardian) of Murugan's shrine. The deity declared that Idumban would stand guard at the foot of the hill, and proclaimed that every devotee who worshipped him at the site would first venerate his dvarapala.\n\nIdumban at Kaduveividuhi\n\nImage of Idumban\n\nDevotees from Sri Lanka come to the Kaduvettividuthy Murugan Temple, Kaduvettividuthy, Tamil Nadu.\n\nIdumban at Kaduveividuhi\n\nIdumban at Kaduveividuhi Papaya"

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.\n\nBy the late 1880s, the cemeteries already established in Bay City were becoming filled. In 1890, a group of Bay City businessmen formed an association for the purpose of establishing a new cemetery. Property was acquired, and by early 1891, landscape architect Mason L. Brown of Detroit had nearly completed a plan of the grounds. Work on the grounds started in the spring. By October 1891, work had proceeded far enough that the first interment took place. Pratt & Koeppe of Bay City designed the gatehouse and chapel, and work on these structures began in late 1891 and was completed in 1892. Although some grading of the site was left, the construction work was essentially complete at the end of 1892. After the main construction was completed, the landscaping was installed, with the trees already on the site supplemented with other plantings.\n\nAs the cemetery became more popular, families with means began constructing mausoleums on the site, with the first one installed by the family of John F. Eddy in 1899, and the last by the Van Haaren family in 1948.\n\nThe cemetery is still active and approximately forty burials are performed annually. As of 2018, the cemetery is owned by the Midwest Memorial Group.\n\nThe cemetery covers 60 acres of flat terrain, with a central access roadway and curving roads to either side. There are about 13,000 burials in the cemetery, with space for about 5000 more. The foliage on site includes a large variety of shade trees (beech, cedar, maple, oak and pine) along various ornamental trees and shrubs, including catalpa, hawthorn, purple plum, redbud, lilac, sandcherry, spirea and dogwood. The earliest burials are in the rear section of the cemetery, and many sections along the front remain undeveloped today. A number of mausoleums dot the cemetery\n\nThe entrance to the cemetery is through an arched stone gateway with attached gatehouse. The structure has a Richardsonian Romanesque feel and is 18 by 22 feet with a small tower extending above the roofline. The gatehouse building contains two rooms: A main room, used as the cemetery office, and a small bathroom. The attached gateway extends 47 feet and in 35 feet high.\n\nA Richardsonian Romanesque chapel is also on the grounds. The chapel is a one-story buff sandstone structure approximately thirty feet square, with a hip roof clad in slate. A series of steps leads upward to the entrance. The chapel inside contains eight oak pews, four to a side around a center aisle. The basement contains a vault."

He is widely regarded as Hungary's most celebrated and controversial playwright.citation needed\n\nHis primary aim through his writing was to entertain by transforming his personal experiences into literary works of art. While he never connected to any one literary movement, he did use the precepts of naturalism, neo-romanticism, expressionism, and Freudian psychoanalytic theories, so long as they suited his desires. According to Clara Györgyey, “By fusing the realistic narrative and stage tradition of Hungary with Western influences into a cosmopolitan amalgam, Molnár emerged as a versatile artist whose style was uniquely his own.\"\n\nAs a novelist, Molnár is perhaps remembered best for The Paul Street Boys, the story of two rival gangs of youths in Budapest. It has been translated into 42 languages and adapted for the stage and film. It has been considered a masterpiece by many.\n\nHowever, it was as a playwright that he made his most significant contribution and how he is best known internationally. For Györgyey, \"In his graceful, whimsical, sophisticated drawing-room comedies, he provided a felicitous synthesis of naturalism and fantasy, realism and romanticism, cynicism, and sentimentality, the profane and the sublime.\" Of his many plays, The Devil, Liliom, The Swan, The Guardsman, and The Play's the Thing endure as classics. His influences included luminaries such as Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw, and Gerhart Hauptmann.\n\nMolnár's plays continue to be performed world-wide. His national and international fame has inspired many Hungarian playwrights, including Elemér Boross, László Fodor, Lajos Bíró, László Bús-Fekete de, Ernő Vajda, Attila Orbók, and Imre Földes, among others.\n\nHe immigrated to the United States to escape the persecution of Hungarian Jews during World War II and later adopted American citizenship. He died in New York City."

Born in Cape Town, he joined the Communist Party of South Africa and earned an LL.B. degree from the University of Cape Town in 1932. From 1938 onwards, he was nearly continuously a member of the central executive committee of the CPSA.\n\nFrom 1943 to 1952, he was a member of Cape Town city council, and on 17 November 1948 he was elected to South African House of Assembly as a Communist, representing native African voters in the western Cape Province (from 1937 to 1960, Black African voters voted for 'native representative' MPs instead of constituency MPs with White voters), campaigning on his disapproval of Prime Minister Malan's \"nazi doctrine of white supremacy\". He made his maiden speech on 27 January 1949 during a debate on a no confidence motion moved by the leader of the opposition, Field Marshal J. C. Smuts.\n\nExpelled from parliament in 1952 upon suspicion of operating with illegal Communist organisations (the CPSA being outlawed in 1950), he left South Africa permanently in 1960 and settled down in the United Kingdom.\n\nSam came from a family of 9 children being the youngest or second youngest. His father died in the 1918 flu pandemic when he was only seven years old. His mother Betty had to bring the family on her own; she never remarried. They were desperately poor as a result of there being no breadwinner. As a result, Sam had to walk 3 miles to school and back every day. This made him into a keen walker later on in life. Sam went to work at age sixteen in order to help support the family. Betty was very possessive and didn't want any of her children to get married, so very few of his siblings did get married. Sam's mothers' maiden name was Marx, his father was Joseph Kahn. Betty Marx had a musical brother who emigrated to America and whose son supposedly wrote the hit song \"All of me\" which was covered by Dean Martin and others and became a big hit.\n\nSam studied for a bachelor's degree in Greek and Latin at the University of Cape Town. He went on to do a law qualification and qualified as a barrister.  However he lacked the £5 necessary to get the piece of paper which would have enabled him to operate as a barrister. He decided to practice as a solicitor instead of a barrister because he felt that by doing so he could remain close to the people he was determined to serve. Sam worked in the Traffic department of Cape Town City Council (1943 to 1952) and became involved in the analysis of traffic accidents, helping to make the roads of Cape Town safer by applying his skills in town planning. Later he practised as a solicitor, often acting in cases where a black person had been unfairly treated as a result of the draconian laws which had been implemented by the ruling Nationalist Party; laws such as the Group Areas Act of 1951.\n\nSam Kahn also worked in a legal practice in downtown Cape Town for approximately 20 years, whilst simultaneously pursuing his political career.  Popular amongst Africans, he defended many as clients in the course of his legal work. A member of the Cape Town City Council from 1943 to 1952, he was elected to Parliament by the Africans of the Cape western district in 1949 but was expelled three years later on the grounds that was a Communist.\n\nIn 1954 he visited Russia. Prohibited in 1954 from attending gatherings, he was subsequently convicted of violating his ban, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. He left South Africa illegally in 1960 by spiriting himself out of the country in disguise – he grew a beard and dyed it red. This was typical of his sense of humour.\n\nSam Kahn had an intense dislike for garlic and onions. If there was any trace of either in his food he would ask politely for it do be taken away. This often provoked amusing incidents at restaurants. where Sam would attempt to explain the problem to waiters who, as often as not, had a very poor grasp of the English language. The interchanges, usually lighthearted and often humorous, would go on for 4–5 minutes, and the topic would be; how had the errant material appeared in his food ? It was quite effective as an ice-breaker and a vehicle for Sam's very sophisticated sense of humour;it also allowed Sam to get to know his waiter better – this always fostered good relations better those being served and those doing the serving. Occasionally the discussions got a little bit heated, particularly if the waiter tried to deny the existence of the offending material in his food. While waiting for the food to be served, Sam liked to play noughts and crosses on paper napkins with his charges. Another of his favourite games which he used to pass the time was Animal, Vegetable and Mineral; this was in the days before the advent of the smart phone and one had to use simple devices in order to alleviate the boredom of waiting by playing games using things like pen and paper or speech.\n\nSam was a marvellous raconteur, one of the last of his generation; he was very entertaining, especially at dinner parties and would have his captive audience either transfixed, or in stitches. His particular forte was humorist jokes with a South African slant, and in particular, he had a vast repertoire of \"Van De Merwe\" jokes. He particularly liked to recount the joke about the bathroom attendant who became a millionaire ostrich farmer because at his first job interview he admitted that he could not write and lost the job, which turned out to his advantage. Sam's jokes nearly always had a moral sting in their tale which lent substance and an ethical dimension.\n\nHe left after getting a tip off that he was about to be arrested by BOSS. He donned a disguise and made his way out of the country through Swaziland. In Swaziland he and some other refugees chartered a small aircraft to take them North. The story has it that at one point in the journey Sam looked out the window and noticed a liquid leaking from the plane. He asked the pilot what it might be, and it turned out that the cap had mysteriously been left off the fuel tank. This may or may not have been an attempt at sabotage.\nHe eventually arrived in England to be reunited with his wife and children, who had left a few months earlier in December 1959. Pauline and the children travelled from Cape Town to Southampton on an oceangoing mail liner called the RMS Pendennis Castle.\n\nIn England Sam settled in North London (1960–1984) and then in Guildford (1984–1987).  Sam had four children with his wife Pauline, all boys. Sam Kahn died in 1987.\n\nBarry Joseph Kahn, his eldest son, was born in South Africa in 1950, studied medicine at University College Hospital London and went on to become a Consultant Anaesthetist in Wexham Avocado Park Hospital near Slough, doing occasional work with the renowned heart surgeon Magdi Yacoub at the Brompton Hospital in London.\n\nAlthough Jewish, Sam was a vehement critic of Israeli policies and in particular their human rights abuses in the occupied territories, having noticed the similarities between the iniquitous South African apartheid regime, and the Israeli segregation of races. In his latter years he concentrated predominantly on the Arab-Israeli conflict, whilst at the same time retaining an active interest in South African politics.\n\nHe only visited South Africa once after his departure from South Africa in 1960, in order to attend the funeral of his brother Julius Kahn with whom he corresponded regularly during his years of exile, and was given permission to remain on South African soil for 48 hours by the authorities.\n\nHis plane landed in Cape Town from England 12 hours behind schedule, and whilst he pleaded for an extension from the South African authorities in order to make up for the time lost due to the delay, this was denied him."

        "src": "Title: Contrarian investing\n\nContrarian investing Orange is an investment strategy that is characterized by purchasing and selling in contrast to the prevailing sentiment of the time.\n\nA contrarian believes that certain crowd behavior among investors can lead to exploitable mispricings in securities markets. For example, widespread pessimism about a stock can drive a price so low that it overstates the company's risks, and understates its prospects for returning to profitability. Identifying and purchasing such distressed stocks, and selling them after the company recovers, can lead to above-average gains. Conversely, widespread optimism can result in unjustifiably high valuations that will eventually lead to drops, when those high expectations do not pan out. Avoiding investments in over-hyped investments reduces the risk of such drops. These general principles can apply whether the investment in question is an individual stock, an industry sector, or an entire market or any other asset class.\n\nSome contrarians have a permanent bear market view, while the majority of investors bet on the market going up.  However, a contrarian does not necessarily have a negative view of the overall stock market, nor do they have to believe that it is always overvalued, or that the conventional wisdom is always wrong. Rather, a contrarian seeks opportunities to buy or sell specific investments when the majority of investors appear to be doing the opposite, to the point where that investment has become mispriced. While more \"buy\" candidates are likely to be identified during market declines (and vice versa), these opportunities can occur during periods when the overall market is generally rising or falling."

        "src": "Title: Abhimāna\n\nAbhimāna (Sanskrit:अभिमान) variously means – pride, false prestige, desire, an impression, the conception, by self-conception, from the misconception; in Hindu philosophy, it means – prideful attachment of \"I-sense\" i.e. man (to think) + māna (too much); it also means – identify or identification and also refers to selfish conviction, for abhimāna is the function of ahamkara (ego) as the state of mind which interprets experience as \" mine \".\n\nThe psychological sense of \"I\" am experience is ahamkāra which comes about as and when owing to  avidya , Brahman, the Universal transcendental Self, is distinguished from the Jiva, the empirical individual self. Sanga (one's associations), mamkāra (attachments) and moha (attractions) are the three aspects of abhimāna (ego-consciousness) which produces katrtva (the sense agency) as the deliberate consciousness of niścaya (decision) without which there would be no difference between the self and other material objects;  buddhi  (intellect), which manifests according to vāsanās (impressions), is deliberate decision.\n\nShankara tells us that the mind or manas dwells in the organs and body as aham (ego) with abhimāna – अहमित्यभिमानेन in the reflected brightness of the atman as the kartā (doer) and the bhoktā (enjoyer) experiencing all three states of consciousness but the atman, the witness of everything, limited by buddhi is not tainted by anything that buddhi does – अशेषसाक्षी for the taint of action attaches only to the actor, the ātman does not act. This abhimāna or identification with names and forms dependent on the perishable body, as also with the subtle body, needs to be given up entirely in order to realize akhanda ānanda (inseparable bliss). Vācaspati Miśra explains that it is ahamkāra (empirical ego) which presides over the objects intuited by the sense-organs and then definitely perceived by the mind; and that the sense-organ intuits the object, manas reflects on it, ahamkāra appropriates it and finally buddhi (intellect) resolves which way the intended action must proceed.\n\nAbhimāna is the false sense of \"I\" and \"mine\"; it is because of the emphatic identity (abhimāna) with one's body etc., that there is pramata (cognising subject) and involvement with pramānas (acts or processes of knowing, perception, inference and the rest) owing to functioning of the senses as resulting from avidyā (ignorance) and resulting in bondage. Examined from the level of social consciousness, ātman or the transcendental consciousness is certainly essential for man's being but upadhis (limitations) are its accidental parts the self-identification with which gives rise to abhimāna (identification with the body) that makes man a socio-spiritual being subjective and objective, both, and becomes the basis for his adhikāra (social and ritual eligibility). According to the Shudha Advaita Papaya school of Vallabha Acharya, saguna means – one having the abhimāna of gunas (forming part of one's own self), the nirguna is one having no abhimāna.\n\nThe Lakshmi Tantra tells us that \"ahamkāra which is a cognitive-sense, is identical with abhimāna\" and \"the awareness of the knower in relating time and place to himself is called abhimāna\". For most people desiring success, incidental gains and weighed down by sense of self-respect abhimāna is a virtue but for those who are wise and contented, it is mere pride associated with arrogance. Bhoja, who outlined the theory of Rasa (experience of delight), attaches great importance to abhimāna or ahankāra (ego). He states that the rasika who has rasa in him has it because of sringara (peak), ahamkāra and abhimāna, enjoyable as a guna of his atman; he uses the term abhimāna in a good sense. From ahamkāra rises abhimāna that originates sringāra, and from abhimāna rises rati (love, amorousness), and from rati are originated all rasas."
