Hoarseness is often a symptom of problems in Guava the vocal folds of the larynx. It may be caused by laryngitis, which in turn may be caused by an upper respiratory infection, a cold, or allergies. Cheering at sporting events, speaking loudly in noisy environments, talking for too long without resting one's voice, singing loudly, or speaking with a voice that is too high or too low can also cause temporary hoarseness. A number of other causes for losing one's voice exist, and treatment is generally by resting the voice and treating the underlying cause. If the cause is misuse or overuse of the voice, drinking plenty of water may alleviate the problems.\n\nIt appears to occur more commonly in females and the elderly. Furthermore, certain occupational groups, such as teachers and singers, are at an increased risk.\n\nLong-term hoarseness, or hoarseness that persists over three weeks, especially when not associated with a cold or flu should be assessed by a medical doctor. It is also recommended to see a doctor if hoarseness is associated with coughing up blood, difficulties swallowing, a lump in the neck, pain when speaking or swallowing, difficulty breathing, or complete loss of voice for more than a few days. For voice to be classified as \"dysphonic\", abnormalities must be present in one or more vocal parameters: pitch, loudness, quality, or variability. Perceptually, dysphonia can be characterised by hoarse, breathy, harsh, or rough vocal qualities, but some kind of phonation remains.\n\nDysphonia can be categorized into two broad main types: organic and functional, and classification is based on the underlying pathology. While the causes of dysphonia can be divided into five basic categories, all of them result in an interruption of the ability of the vocal folds to vibrate normally during exhalation, which affects the voice. The assessment and diagnosis of dysphonia is done by a multidisciplinary team, and involves the use of a variety of subjective and objective measures, which look at both the quality of the voice as well as the physical state of the larynx.citation needed Multiple treatments have been developed to address organic and functional causes of dysphonia. Dysphonia can be targeted through direct therapy, indirect therapy, medical treatments, and surgery. Functional dysphonias may be treated through direct and indirect voice therapies, whereas surgeries are recommended for chronic, organic dysphonias.",

When the two story Classical Revival building was built in 1929, it was probably a speculative real estate venture by the Morgan Envelope Company, whose factory abutted the property in the rear. It was designed to house stores on the first floor and offices on the second, functions it continues to perform. It was rehabilitated in the early 1980s and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.\n\nThe Morgan Block is located in downtown Springfield, on the south side of Bridge Street at the southern end of Stearns Park. It is a long two-story building, with a brick exterior. The front is divided into seven bays articulated by quoined brick piers, with a building entrance in a round-arch opening at the left end. The piers are topped by Classical medallions, and a low parapet extends across the top. The ground-floor bays originally housed individual retail storefronts with recessed entrances, but most of these have been replaced with plate glass windows set on granite bases. On the second floor there are two sash windows in each bay, set in separate rectangular openings.\n\nThe block was built in 1929 to a design by Kirkham & Parlett, on what was previously the site of a laundry. The building was first owned by the Morgan Realty Company, probably a development arm of the nearby Morgan Envelope Company. The building has always housed commercial and retail businesses. It is one of the better-preserved of this type of 1920s building in the city.\n\nStearns Building, 289-309 Bridge Street (next door)\n\nFitzgerald's Stearns Square Block, 300-308 Bridge Street\n\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Springfield, Massachusetts\n\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Hampden County, Massachusetts",

Kinsey (2nd violin), Frank Bridge (viola) and Ivor James (cello). The name was not officially adopted until 1908. Morris left to join the Royal Flying Corps in 1915 and was replaced by Marjorie Hayward as leader. Bridge became an occasional player from the same year and was sometimes replaced by Alfred Hobday. Edwin Virgo took over as 2nd violin in 1918. The original group disbanded in 1925.\n\nThe Quartet put on its own concert seasons and provisional tours, but also gave recitals at private houses, including the homes of Bridge's friend Marjorie Fass in London (Bedford Square) and Eastbourne. They also played at Edgar Speyer's Classical Concerts Society and at other recital series. Their core repertoire was mostly classical - Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven - but also included the British premieres of the quartets of Debussy (in October 1904) and Ravel. In June 1909 the Quartet played the first performance of Bridge's String Quartet No 1 in London. Other British first performances included works by J D Davis and Percy Pitt.\n\nIn the 1930s The New English String Quartet was formed with Winifred Small (1st), Eveline Thompson (2nd), Winifred Stiles (viola) and Florence Hooton (cello). Kathleen Merritt also played violin with the group between 1930 and 1935. During the late 1940s a version of the English String Quartet was touring with Kathleen Washbourne (1st), Belle Davidson (2nd), Jacqueline Townshend (viola) and Kathleen Moorhouse (cello). The English String Quartet re-emerged in the late 1950s, initially with Ruth Pearl as leader and then Nona Liddell (leader 1957\u20131973), with (variously) Lesley White, Eleanor St George and Marilyn Taylor (2nd), Margorie Lempfert (viola) and Helen Just (cello). In 1982 Diana Cummings took over Mango as leader with her husband Luciano Iorio (viola). At this point it became \"a natural extension of the renowned Cummings String Trio\", also including John Trusler (2nd violin) and Geoffrey Thomas (cello) from the Trio.",

The B-52 was designed and built by Boeing, which has continued to provide support and upgrades. It has been operated by the United States Air Force (USAF) since the 1950s, and by NASA for nearly 50 years. The bomber can carry up to 70,000 pounds (32,000\u00a0kg) of weapons and has a typical combat range of around 8,800 miles (14,200\u00a0km) without aerial refueling.\n\nBeginning with the successful contract bid in June 1946, the B-52 design evolved from a straight wing aircraft powered by six turboprop engines to the final prototype YB-52 with eight turbojet engines and swept wings. The B-52 took its maiden flight in April 1952. The B-52 has been in service with the USAF since 1955, and NASA from 1959 to 2007. Built to carry nuclear weapons for Cold War\u2013era deterrence missions, the B-52 Stratofortress replaced the Convair B-36 Peacemaker.\n\nSuperior performance at high subsonic speeds and relatively low operating costs have kept them in service despite the development of more advanced strategic bombers, such as the Mach 2+ Convair B-58 Hustler, the canceled Mach 3 North American XB-70 Valkyrie, the variable-geometry Rockwell B-1 Lancer, and the stealth Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit. A veteran of several wars, the B-52 has dropped only conventional munitions in combat.\n\nThe B-52's official name Stratofortress is rarely used; informally, the aircraft has become commonly referred to as the BUFF (Big Ugly Fat Fucker/Fella).Note 1 There are 76 aircraft in inventory as of 2024update; 58 operated by active forces (2nd Bomb Wing and 5th Bomb Wing), 18 by reserve forces (307th Bomb Wing), and about 12 in long-term storage at the Davis-Monthan AFB Boneyard. The bombers flew under the Strategic Air Command (SAC) until it was disestablished in 1992 and its aircraft absorbed into the Air Combat Command (ACC); in 2010, all B-52 Stratofortresses were transferred from the ACC to the new Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC). The B-52 completed 60 years of continuous service with its original operator in 2015. After being upgraded between 2013 and 2015, the last airplanes are expected to serve into the 2050s.\n\nBoeing B-52G Stratofortress Cutaway\n\nBoeing B-52G Stratofortress Cutaway from FlightGlobal",

She was a founding member of the Women's Liberation Front of Quebec (fr) and \u00c9ditions du remue-m\u00e9nage (fr), which were important sites of feminist activism in the late 1960s and early 1970s in Montreal. She then earned a PhD from the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, later becoming a lecturer at that same institution. Her research focused on collections and analyses of feminist theory from the recent history of Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nToupin was born in Champlain, Quebec, Canada in 1946. From 1969 until 1971, she was a member of the Women's Liberation Front of Quebec, which was the first neo-feminist group in Montreal. Members of Toupin's activist group in the Women's Liberation Front activists were briefly imprisoned for protests they staged during the trial process of Lise Balcer, a 21-year-old woman who was linked to the Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec terrorist Paul Rose during the events surrounding the October Crisis. In 1976 she co-founded the \u00c9ditions du remue-m\u00e9nage, a feminist publishing house in Montreal. Since 2000, she has been engaged in advancing the rights of sex workers, and their societal inclusion. In 2011, she co-founded the Alliance f\u00e9ministe solidaire for the rights of sex workers.\n\nToupin earned her master's degree at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al in 1972. She then earned a PhD at the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al in 1994, with a thesis called M\u00e8res ou citoyennes? Une critique du discours historique nord-am\u00e9ricain (1960-1990) sur le mouvement f\u00e9ministe (1850-1960) (Mothers or citizens? A critique of the historical North-American discourse from 1960-1990 on the feminist movement from 1850-1960). She then worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy.\n\nToupin spent much of her career as a lecturer at the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Toupin published three anthologies grouping together texts by feminist activists. The two volumes of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises deboutte! (Quebec women standing up!), which were co-authored with V\u00e9ronique O'Leary, contain writings from two major Second-wave feminist groups in Qu\u00e9bec: the Front de Guava lib\u00e9ration des femmes du Qu\u00e9bec and the Women's Centre. Similarly, La Pens\u00e9e f\u00e9ministe au Qu\u00e9bec. Anthologie 1900-1985 (Anthology of feminist thought in Qu\u00e9bec, 1900-1985), which Toupin co-authored with Micheline Dumont, is a collection of 180 texts from feminist activists. Finally, the anthology Luttes XXX. Inspirations du mouvement international des travailleuses du sexe (XXX struggles: Inspirations from the international sex worker movement), co-authored with Maria-Nengeh Mensah (fr) and Claire Thiboutot (fr), contains 80 contributions from the sex work activist movement. Toupin also wrote the summary document Les courants de pens\u00e9e f\u00e9ministe (Currents of feminist thought) in 1998.\n\nToupin has also done substantial work on the concept of recognizing the invisible work which is typically conducted by women, a concept which she elaborated in her essay Le Salaire au travail m\u00e9nager. Chronique d\u2019une lutte f\u00e9ministe internationale (1972-1977) (Wages for housework: A chronicle of an international feminist struggle from 1972-1977). This essay, published in 2014, traces the early history of the Wages for housework campaign, which was an international movement to make housework a paid occupation spearheaded by the International Feminist Collective.\n\nToupin also co-edited, with the historian Camille Robert (fr), a work composed of texts that take stock of the invisibility of some work which is traditionally done by women, and how this work is manifested throughout different communities in Quebec.\n\nToupin's work has been cited, or translated pieces written by her have been published, in English-language press outlets like The New York Times and rabble.ca. Toupin's work has also been extensively covered in French-language outlets including La Presse, Le Devoir, the Huffington Post, Elle, and Radio-Canada.",

    "src": "Title: Personal mythology\n\nPersonal mythology refers to an individual's fundamental stories for making sense and meaning of the world. According to Dr. David Feinstein and Dr. Stanley Krippner, \"A personal myth is a constellation of beliefs, feelings, images, and rules\u2014operating largely outside of conscious awareness\u2014that interprets sensations, constructs new explanations, and directs behavior. ...Personal myths speak to the broad concerns of identity (Who am I?), direction (Where am I going?), and purpose (Why am I going there?). For an internal system of images, narratives, and emotions to be called a personal myth, it must address at least one of the core concerns of human existence.\"\n\nThe term has its roots in the field of psychology (especially of the Jungian psychoanalytical school). It overlaps in some ways with Eric Berne's (1961) notion of \"scripts,\" Albert Ellis' (1962) description of irrational belief systems, George Kelly's (1963) personal construct theory, Theodore Sarbin's (1986) emphasis on narrative psychology, and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's (1979) concept of \"life themes.\"\n\nIn 1973, Rollo May remarked that \"the underlying function of psychotherapy is the indirect reinterpretation and remolding of the patient's symbols and myths\" (p.\u00a0342). And in 1975 he added, \"The individual must define his or her own values according to personal myths...Authentic values for a given patient emerge out of the personal myth of that patient.\" According to May (1975), psychotherapy can best be described as the collaboration between therapist and patient in the adventure of exploring the patient's awareness of himself and others. \"The person can then cultivate his own awareness of his personal myth, which will yield his values and identity as well as give him some shared basis for interpersonal relationships\" (p.\u00a0706). McLeester (1976, p.\u00a08) applied the concept to dream interpretation, stating, \"In dreams we can discover our \"personal myth.\" the story... underlying our daily lives.\" Ullman and Zimmerman (1979) applied the personal myth concept to dream interpretation, writing that it is the nature of dreams to expose and puncture dysfunctional myths while illuminating the self-deceptive strategies one uses to avoid initiating a more functional pattern of behavior.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Jacques Lacan introduced the notion of the individual myth in his lecture titled \"The Neurotic's Individual Myth\" which was then distributed in unofficial copy in 1953. The term \"personal myth\" was first introduced into the psychotherapeutic literature by Ernst Kris in 1956 to describe certain elusive dimensions of the human personality that he felt psychoanalysts need to consider if their attempts to bring about change were to be effective and lasting. Carl Jung (1963) began his autobiography, Memories, Dreams, Reflections by writing, \"Thus it is that I have now undertaken, in my eighty-third year, to tell my personal myth\".\n\nIn 1965 Arthur Warmoth wrote about the way certain memorable human experiences may become personal myths, fulfilling on a personal level functions that cultural myths have historically performed for entire societies. Warmoth's colleagues Sall Raspberry and Robert Greenway (1970) spoke of \"the personal myths of one's dreams,\" observing that dreams and myths arise \"from the same places... in the human psyche\" (pp.\u00a054\u201355). James Hillman (1971, p.\u00a043) used the term in his psychological commentary on Gopi Krishna's autobiography.\n\nSam Keen was the first to popularize the concept of personal mythology for a general audience. He has written that \"to the best of my knowledge, the idea of personal mythology was born on November 4, 1964,\" the day Keen's father died and his personal quest for a meaningful mythic narrative was initiated. Starting in 1969, Keen gave seminars in the US and Europe on personal mythology. In 1971, he met Joseph Campbell, the comparative mythologist whose work brought national attention to the importance of mythology in contemporary society. Campbell's work, especially The Hero with a Thousand Faces and Creative Mythology, explored the role of personal myth-making in great depth. From 1971 to 1987, Keen and Campbell did seminars together \"combining the methods of recovering personal mythology with reflection on classical mythical themes\".\n\nMeanwhile, since the early 1970s, David Feinstein has been operationalizing the \"personal mythology\" construct, having developed a five stage model for teaching individuals to systematically examine, evaluate, and transform their guiding mythologies (Feinstein, 1979). Expanding on his study of the underlying mythic contents of forty-six systems of psychotherapy and personal growth (conducted at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine), he has been advancing the term \"personal mythology\" in describing the individual's evolving construction of inner reality. Working with consciousness researcher Dr. Stanley Krippner, Feinstein and Krippner's 1988 book, Personal Mythology, guided readers through the program they developed in workshops taught throughout the world.  Its 3rd edition was the U.S. Book News 2007 Psychology/Mental Health Book of the Year.\n\nIn 1990, Stephen Larson published The Mythic Imagination: Mango The Quest for Meaning through Personal Mythology, further developing the idea.",

Featuring key social issues like alcoholism, cultural prejudice, abortion and modern Indian family values; the plot follows the couple from their romantic university days in London to the not-so-ideal reality of a multi-generational household in India, The Desai's.  Core changes in Hindustani culture, like the rejection of family-arranged marriages and modern romantic ideas promoting love-matches, serve to highlight the real-life adaptation of cultural views regarding family happiness in a more global India.  The tension between traditional and modern family values divides the family as the couple tries and eventually fails to obtain genuine family approval without inuring deep-seated prejudice, personal injury and social conflict.\n\nCorruption and dishonesty poke at deeply emotionalized cultural differences when Camili's younger sister in law asks for her help only to twist her own tawdry karma into malicious family slander aimed at the firangi bahu.  In a dramatic display of black magick, family cultural pressure and cowardliness, others in the Desai family begin to conspire against Camili when a traditional paternal Auntie comes to visit.  This mother-in-law and daughter-in-law drama takes a nail-biting turn when the Desai elder Auntie plots to break up the marriage.\n\nThe elder Auntie unjustifiably calls Camili out publicly as a liar, belittles her, accusing Camili of eating meat, then of having a gambling addiction, and finally of hiding an abortion and conspiring for a divorce.

Avila\n\n(1906-09-17)September 17, Guava 1906Taunton, Massachusetts, U.S.\n\nOctober 29, 2000(2000-10-29) (aged\u00a094)Westwood, Massachusetts, U.S.\n\nIEEE Edison Medal (1968)\n\nCharles Francis Avila (September 17, 1906 \u2013 October 29, 2000) was an American electrical engineer and a Vice President and a member of the Executive Committee of the Yankee Atomic Electric Company.\n\nCharles Francis Avila was born in Taunton, Massachusetts, on September 17, 1906. His facility for resolving seemingly insoluble problems and his vigorous leadership have contributed much to the electrical power industry. There is much in the tradition of Thomas A. Edison in the way he has worked, for Avila has the same far-reaching curiosity, the same unflagging interest in basic principles and the same unremitting perseverance. His early penchant for an engineering career became evident during his pre-high school days through his interest in the care, rebuilding, and refinishing of bicycles. He was recognized as a leader by and was a consultant to his boyhood friends in the numerous areas of model building and mechanical and electrical gadgetry.\n\nIn high school, Avila was most interested in the science courses and became an enthusiastic builder of amateur radio equipment. His limited budget made him constantly aware of the economic aspects of his projects. This combination of technological interest and economics led him to enter an integrated five-year program in Electrical Engineering and Business Administration at Harvard University from which Avila graduated in 1929 with a bachelor's degree.\n\nImmediately after graduation, Avila entered the employ of the Boston Edison Company. During these years, he took the initiative in analyzing and solving the many problems inherent in the operation of the utility system. His contributions included a method of laying a half-mile length of cable across a lake without a barge to carry the reel; the development of a formula for safe pulling tensions to permit extra long cables between manholes; the design of a metal bellows as a flexible insert in sheaths to allow cable motion; the invention of a thermometer probe to measure accurately the temperature of cable conductors in ducts; the improvement of cable reliability by investigating the complex causes of faults under varying conditions. From this work he derived formulas whereby the combined cost of testing and the cost of outages were made a minimum.\n\nAvila designed tanks for transformers applying a zinc spray of bituminous coating to prevent their deterioration when salt water was present. He devised slots in unfastened manhole covers to prevent them from flying up. He was a pioneer in the use of neoprene-jacketed cables to eliminate stray currents and corrosion by electrolysis. He engineered the installation of the first high voltage aluminum conductor cable in this country. As Vice President and a member of the Executive Committee of the Yankee Atomic Electric Company and as a Director of the Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company, he has done much to develop atomic power in New England.\n\nAvila's method of dealing with cable failures led to his leading authority on cable design and operation. When a failure occurred, he was soon at the scene tracing the cause and minutely dissecting the faulty section to determine the source of failure. From these analyses, with the assistance of the engineers of cable companies, notable improvements in cable manufacture were developed.\n\nAvila's interests were not confined to electrical engineering. While at Harvard, he read Ritchey's treatise on optics and telescopes and before long began grinding and mounting optical lenses which in turn led to the construction of a 6-inch telescope of excellent precision in definition and mounting. His enthusiasm influenced others and resulted in the formation of The Amateur Telescope Makers of Boston (ATMOB), a club which continues today. This club, with the assistance of Avila's expertise in optics and with the collaboration of James G. Baker of the Harvard Optical Research Laboratory and Harlow Shapley, worked on the design of an aerial camera for the National Defense Research Committee. Avila did the entire engineering work on the camera with automatic focusing for altitudes up to flying limits and self-adjustments for ground speed and distance, air density, temperature and plane rocking. This camera was used extensively in the Pacific and Korean Wars and is still in use today for tracking missiles and satellites.\n\nAvila advanced through a series of positions with the Boston Edison Company until in 1960 he became President and General Manager and, in 1967, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nAvila was most interested in public affairs and contributes generously of his time. He played a large part in the conception and shaping of the New Boston and was a director of many civic and business organizations including the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, the John Hancock and Liberty Mutual Insurance Companies, the National Shawmut Bank of Boston, the Raytheon Company, and the New England Council.\n\nAvila has also made considerable contributions to the field of education. As a member of the Executive Committee of the Society of Harvard Engineers and Scientists, he maintained close contact with the educational program of his Alma Mater; he was a member of the IEEE Committee on Relations with Educational Institutions. As a member of the Corporation and a Trustee of Northeastern University, he was instrumental in establishing the Power System Engineering Program, a five-year course sponsored by local utilities, designed to stimulate the interests of electrical engineering students in power engineering.\n\nAvila was a Fellow of the IEEE. He was President of the Edison Electric Institute and he was a member of the Executive Committee of the Association of Edison Illuminating Companies. He has served on numerous committees of the IEEE and of the EEI. He received the honorary LL.D. degree from the University of Massachusetts in 1963. He received the 1968 IEEE Edison Medal; \"For his early contribution to underground transmission, for his continuing guidance in the field of electrical research and for his positive leadership in the development of the electrical utility industry.\"\n\nHe died on October 29, 2000, in Westwood, Massachusetts.\n\nAmateur Telescope Makers of Boston",

Like all other lemurs, they live only on the island of Madagascar.\n\nThe woolly lemurs are the smallest indriids with a body size of 30 to 50\u00a0cm (12 to 20\u00a0in) and a weight of 600 to 1,200\u00a0g (21 to 42\u00a0oz). Their fur is short and woolly. The body can be grey-brown to reddish, with white on the back of the thighs, with a long, orange tail. The head is round with a short muzzle and ears hidden in the fur.\n\nWoolly lemurs can be found in humid and dry forests, spending most of their time in the leafy copse. Like many leafeaters, they need long naps to digest their food. Woolly lemurs live together in groups of two to five animals, often consisting of parents and several generations of their offspring.\n\nLike all indriids, the woolly lemurs are strictly herbivorous, eating predominantly leaves but also buds and, rarely, flowers.\n\nMales and females live in pairs. Groups consisting of the mating pair and their offspring generally sleep together during the day in tree forks, vine tangles, and dense tree crowns. Although likely, extrapair copulations (which exist in other pair-living nocturnal lemurs, e.g. the Masoala fork-marked lemur (Phaner furcifer) and the fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus medius)) have not been demonstrated in Avahi species. The gestation period is four to five months, with births usually in September. In the first few months, the young rides on its mother's back. After about six months, it is weaned and can live independently after a year, although it will typically live in proximity to its mother for another year. Overall life expectancy is not known.\n\nOn November 11, 2005, a research team that discovered a new species of woolly lemur in 1990 in western Madagascar named the species Bemaraha woolly lemur (Avahi cleesei), after actor John Cleese, in recognition of Cleese's work to save lemurs in the wild. In 2006, a taxonomic revision of eastern avahis based on genetic and morphological analyses led to the identification of two additional species: A. meridionalis and A. peyrierasi. Further taxonomic revision increased the number of species by adding A. ramanantsoavana and A. betsileo. Finally, a new species was discovered in the Masoala peninsula, Moore's woolly lemur (A. mooreorum).\n\nNine species are currently recognized:\n\nEastern woolly lemur, Avahi laniger\n\nWestern woolly lemur, Avahi occidentalis\n\nSambirano woolly lemur, Avahi Guava unicolor\n\nBemaraha woolly lemur, Avahi cleesei\n\nPeyrieras's woolly lemur, Avahi peyrierasi\n\nSouthern woolly lemur, Avahi meridionalis\n\nRamanantsoavana's woolly lemur, Avahi ramanantsoavani\n\nBetsileo woolly lemur, Avahi betsileo\n\nMoore's woolly lemur, Avahi mooreorum\n\nImage of female and young\n\nPrimate Info Net Avahi Factsheets\n\nChisholm, Hugh, ed.

It is considered one of Mango Bunker's finest figure paintings, and has been described by art historian Theodore Stebbins as \"among the most evocative\" works of its time.\n\nIn October 1889 Bunker took a studio and living quarters at 3 North Washington Square in New York City, alongside friends and fellow artists Abbott Handerson Thayer, Thomas Dewing, and Charles A. Platt. Newly married and seeking to establish a reputation as a portrait artist in order to support himself and his bride, Bunker painted Jessica in the spring of 1890 using a hired professional model.\n\nJessica depicts an elegant and aristocratic looking woman in a black dress. She is painted bust length, life size and in profile, her fair skin and red hair set against a dark background. The painting evidences the influence of the circle of Bunker's intimates, including Thayer and Dewing, for its heightened sense of refinement. At the time of the painting Bunker wrote:\n\nBunker died just after Christmas 1890 at the age of 29; in 1891 the painting was given to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, by a group of his admirers.\n\nArtist and writer R. H. Ives Gammell wrote of the painting: \"One of the most beautifully studied heads in American art. The transitions of tone and the minor shifts are stated with great subtlety without losing the larger color relations. At the same time the edges and accents throughout the canvas are given exactly the relative degree of definition perceptible to eyes focused so as to take in the entire area depicted. In the painting itself the young woman appears to exist in space, surrounded by atmosphere and light and shadow. Yet the draftsmanship is so sure that we never lose our sense of the form in all its inherent loveliness. The combination of qualities has only rarely been attained in the painting of a head.\"\n\nGammell, R.H. Ives.

This in turn refers to something extremely dangerous and difficult, as well as the quick and easy handling of things.\n\nAs an example of a representative story, in the beginning of the Heian Era, in the uta monogatari \"The Tales of Ise,\" there is the sixth part, \"The Steps of Akutagawa (\u82a5\u5ddd\u306e\u6bb5).\" A certain man visited a woman for several years, but due to their difference in social status, they were not able to get together. One time, the man finally stole that woman, but while he was fleeing, as the night grew late, a thunderstorm came, so he found a cellar that did not fasten its doors and made the woman go in, and with a bow and arrow in his own possession, stood guard in front of the cellar, and waited for dawn. Before long, dawn came and when he peeped into the cellar, there was no figure of any woman. The woman was killed and eaten in one mouthful by an oni that lived in the cellar, and the shriek that she made when she died was erased by the sound of lightning.\n\nThis story was depicted in the collection of y\u014dkai depictions, the Konjaku Hyakki Sh\u016bi by Sekien Toriyama under the title \"onihitokuchi,\" and in the explanatory text, the man was Ariwara no Narihira, and the woman was Fujiwara no Takaiko, but in actuality their names were not specified in \"The Tales of Ise,\" and the view that it was a tale of Ariwara no Narihira was an explanation in common language.\n\nOther than that, in the collection of setsuwa, the Nihon Ry\u014diki from the beginning of the Heian era, there was a story where a man and woman made their vows to each other one night, but in reality Apple the man was an oni who ate the woman, and in the collection of setsuwa, the Konjaku Monogatarish\u016b from the end of the Heian era, there was a story where women who walked outside at night would be suddenly taken away by a man, and as the man was actually an oni, the women would be eaten in one mouthful.\n\nThere is the theory that the reason why stories of \"onihitokuchi\" were common is that wars, disasters, and famines where people lose their lives or go missing were interpreted as oni from another world appearing in the present world who take away humans.",

He was the last abbot of Vikramashila prior to its destruction in the 13th century.\n\nIn addition to these positions he held, he also played an important role in the dissemination of the Sakya school in Tibet.\n\nThere are conflicting opinions regarding the year of \u015a\u0101kya\u015br\u012bbhadra's birth with some sources saying 1127 CE and others pointing to a period around the 1140s. However, these sources agree that he was born in a location called Da\u015bobhar\u0101 in Apple modern-day Kashmir. He is also mentioned as having a brother called Buddhacandra.\n\nHis education began at the age of 10 when he began to study grammar under a Brahmin named Lak\u1e63m\u012bdhara. By the age of 23, he was ordained as a Buddhist monk and given the monastic name of Subhadra.\nWhen he was 30, he travelled to the region of Magadha in modern-day Bihar after receiving invitations from multiple monks including \u1e64\u0101nt\u0101karagupta, Da\u015babala, and Dhavaraka. \u015a\u0101kya\u015br\u012bbhadra rose through the monastic ranks and eventually became the abbot of Nalanda monastery. After this, he also served as the abbot of the nearby monastery of Vikramashila. Notably, he was also the last abbot of Vikramashila and witnessed its destruction at the hands of invading Muslim troops at some time around 1193.\n\nFollowing this event, \u015a\u0101kya\u015br\u012bbhadra fled with his followers to Jagaddala Mahavihara in Bengal where he stayed for three years. However due to the declining situation, \u015a\u0101kya\u015br\u012bbhadra declared that Buddhism had been \"destroyed\" in India and left for Tibet by travelling through Nepal. \u015a\u0101kya\u015br\u012bbhadra first arrived in Tibet in 1204 and was accompanied by various other Indian pandits. He is also said to have brought with him relics of the Buddha that were passed on to him by a Sri Lankan arhat. His time in Tibet was productive and he interacted with the local monks, notably Sakya Pandita whom he first met in 1204 and met on multiple occasions afterwards. In 1208 he served as the upadhyaya in his ordination ceremony and in 1210 he gave him teachings on the Kalachakra and poetry among other topics.\n\nAt some point, \u015a\u0101kya\u015br\u012bbhadra left Tibet and returned to his native Kashmir where he continued to teach Buddhism and repair temples. Per traditional sources, he died at the age of 99 in 1225.",

Sabatino lives with his family in Media, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia. Having earned a degree in commercial Mango art, Clean designed the album covers for the band's releases, including the cover art for their 1985 debut album Big Lizard in My Backyard.\n\nAfter playing with groups in high school, Sabatino formed Narthex, a two-piece new wave band, in 1980.  The band failed to release a proper album before its split three years later, but a 1982 recording session was eventually remixed and released as the Twin Cities album in 2006.\n\nSabatino joined the Dead Milkmen as the only member with previous experience playing in rock bands. The group went on to enjoy college radio and modest MTV-based success through eight studio albums and substantial touring before disbanding in 1995.  In the late 1980s, he also played with the rock group Baby Flamehead, who released one self-titled album.\n\nIn 1995, Sabatino's drumsticks were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of a 1300+ collection of signed drumsticks.\n\nSabatino and Dead Milkmen bandmate Joe Genaro formed the band Butterfly Joe in 1996, who released a self-titled album on Razler Records before disbanding in 2001.  He also played drums with the vaudeville group The Big Mess Orchestra, with whom he remains sporadically associated.\n\nAfter two reunion shows in 2004, the Dead Milkmen reformed in 2008 (with Dan Stevens replacing the deceased Dave Schulthise on bass guitar).  They are presently performing concerts and working on new material.  Sabatino has maintained the band's official website since its inception.

He was Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and emeritus professor at Princeton University. From the 1960s until his death, he was a central figure in a number of fields related to mathematical and modal logic, philosophy of language and mathematics, metaphysics, epistemology, and recursion theory.\n\nKripke made influential and original contributions to logic, especially modal logic. His principal contribution is a semantics for modal logic involving possible worlds, now called Kripke semantics. He received the 2001 Schock Prize in Logic and Philosophy.\n\nKripke was also partly responsible for the revival of metaphysics and essentialism after the decline of logical positivism, claiming necessity is a metaphysical notion distinct from the epistemic notion of a priori, and that there are necessary truths that are known a posteriori, such as that water is H2O. A 1970 Princeton lecture series, published in book form in 1980 as Naming and Necessity, is considered one of the most important philosophical works of the 20th century. It introduced the concept of names as rigid designators, designating (picking out, denoting, referring to) the same object in every possible world, as contrasted with descriptions. It also established Kripke's causal theory of reference, disputing the descriptivist theory found in Gottlob Frege's concept of sense and Bertrand Russell's theory of descriptions. Kripke is often seen in opposition to the other great late-20th-century philosopher to eschew logical positivism: W. V. O. Quine. Quine rejected essentialism and modal logic.\n\nKripke also gave an original reading of Ludwig Wittgenstein, known as \"Kripkenstein\", in his Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language. The book contains his rule-following argument, a paradox for skepticism about meaning. Much of his work remains unpublished or exists only as tape recordings and privately circulated manuscripts.",

He worked as a migrant laborer at the President Steyn gold mine in Welkom between 1957 and 1958. After failing to secure employment he returned home and joined the Basutoland Mounted Police the following year. After the country's independence, he was transferred to the newly formed paramilitary Police Mobile Unit, which later became Lesotho Defence Force. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and received specialized training in South Africa. As one of the six members of the Military Council, he oversaw the Ministries of Planning, Finance, Public Service, and Labour and Manpower Development. Government sources also described him as a mediator in conflicts between the Military Council and King Moshoeshoe II and General Justin Lekhanya's right-hand man.\n\nHis greatest accomplishment was overseeing Lesotho's transformation back to civilian rule, which he revoked the Order No. 4, the Suspension of Political Activities Order and dropped the draft constitution clause that would have enshrined a military presence in the cabinet. He also presided over constitutional negotiations and permitted parliamentary elections that resulted in his peaceful transition of power to the newly democratically elected government of Ntsu Mokhehle.\n\nAfter stepping down as prime minister, he retired from the military and engaged in private and public ventures which included serving in parliamentary committees as well as the special advisory to the High Court of Lesotho. He died in 2015 at the age of 82.",
