Unlike Mesmer, who claimed that hypnosis was mediated by \"animal magnetism\", Faria understood that it worked purely by the power of suggestion. In the early 19th century, Abb\u00e9 Faria introduced oriental hypnosis to Paris.\n\nFaria was one of the first to depart from the theory of the \"magnetic fluid\", to place in relief the importance of suggestion, and to demonstrate the existence of \"autosuggestion\"; he also established that what he termed nervous sleep belongs to the natural order. From his earliest magnetizing s\u00e9ances, in 1814, he boldly developed his doctrine. Nothing comes from the magnetizer; everything comes from the subject and takes place in his imagination generated from within the mind. Magnetism is only a form of sleep. Although of the moral order, the magnetic action is often aided by physical, or rather by physiological, means\u2013fixedness of look and cerebral fatigue.\n\nFaria changed the terminology of mesmerism. Previously, the focus was on the \"concentration\" of the subject. In Faria's terminology the operator became \"the concentrator\" and somnambulism was viewed as a lucid sleep. The method of hypnosis used by Faria is command, following expectancy. The theory of Abb\u00e9 Faria is now known as Fariism. Later, Ambroise-Auguste Li\u00e9beault (1864\u20131904), the founder of the Nancy School, and \u00c9mile Cou\u00e9 (1857\u20131926), father of applied conditioning, developed the theory of suggestion and autosuggestion and began using them as therapeutic tools. Johannes Schultz developed these theories as Autogenic training.",

It is one of the five gel-forming mucins.  MUC-5B can be found in whole saliva, normal lung mucus, and cervical mucus. In some diseases, such as COPD, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), and H. pylori-associated gastric disease, the gene has been found to be upregulated, and this may be related to the pathogenesis of these conditions.\n\nAll mucins are synthesized in secretory cells known as goblet cells or mucous cells, depending on the tissue location.  Their creation, while still not completely understood, begins in the endoplasmic reticulum.  From there, the Golgi apparatus builds the O-linked glycans found in mucins.  Finally, they are packaged into secretory granules.",

    "src": "Title: Murder of Ibrahim Ali\n\nThe Guava death of Ibrahim Ali (1978 \u2013 February 21, 1995) took place in Marseille, France, in 1995. Then aged 17, Ibrahim Ali, a French citizen of Comorian origins, was shot and killed by Robert Lagier on 21 February 1995.\n\nOn the night of February 21, 1995, Robert Lagier and his two friends Mario d'Ambrosio and Pierre Giglio, supporters of the far-right Front National headed to the immigrant neighbourhoods of north Marseille to hang posters for their party's presidential candidate, Jean-Marie Le Pen. Under a smiling image of Mr Le Pen, the poster said: \"With Le Pen, Three million Immigrants Sent Home\". At a traffic intersection, the men saw ten Afro-French youths running past them to get to a bus stop. They had just finished their rap rehearsal and carried instruments and sound equipment, and were running to avoid missing the last bus home. Robert Lagier drew his .22 pistol from an ankle holster. 17-year old Ibrahim Ali took a single bullet in the back, from which it struck his heart. He collapsed to the ground and quickly died of blood loss. Marco d'Ambrosio also drew his pistol and fired a few shots at the retreating Afro-French, though he didn't hit anyone.\n\nAfter the incident, Laiger falsely claimed the youths had thrown stones at his car, and he was defending himself. However, police found no dents or cracks on the windshield and no rocks in the intersection around where his car was parked. The National Front backed Laiger completely, forming the \"DGL Association\" (after their initials) to \"help our prisoners\". Bruno Megret, considered the successor to Le Pen within the NF, falsely claimed that the men had been \"violently attacked by about 15 Comorians\". At the trial, Megret refused to apologize to the victim's family on the ground that \"there is no collective responsibility in French law\", but he praised the FN members as \"average Frenchmen\" who \"deserve respect and dedicate themselves to others, to love of their country and defence of their people.\"\n\nJean-Marie Le Pen initially responded to the murder, saying \"at least this unfortunate incident has brought to everyone's attention the presence in Marseille of 50,000 Comorians. What are they doing here?\" However, following another murder of immigrants by members of the National Front, Le Pen stated, \"The people who did this are criminals and should be arrested by the police.\" Bruno Megret declared, \"the blame is on massive and uncontrolled immigration... if our billstickers hadn't been armed, they would have probably been dead.\"\n\nRobert Lagier was ultimately convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison for murder. His friend d'Ambrosio was convicted of attempted murder and convicted to 10 years in prison. Pierre Giglio, the third FN man, received a two-year sentence for illegally carrying a gun in his car.\n\nAssociations and elected officials from the city of Marseille have tried since the events, without success, to create a day in memory of Ibrahim on each 21st of February. Several other actions have been proposed in order to denounce racism but none have been implemented until 2015, when a memorial plate was installed where the incident took place. In February 2021, the city council decided to rename the Avenue des Aygalades to Avenue Ibrahim-Ali.",

It was merged with three other companies to form the Port Royal and Western Carolina Railway, which was reorganized in 1896 as the Charleston and Western Carolina Railway.\n\nThe company was chartered in 1877 to connect its namesake cities, and was incorporated on February 3, 1880. Patrick H. Bradley served as president until the incorporation, at which time he stepped down citing poor health to become vice president. Eugene F. Verdery was appointed president at the incorporation meeting, and the interests of the elected board of directors were split with ten directors from Georgia and six directors from South Carolina.note 1 Bonds were issued for the railroad's construction, including a separate $50,000 bond to build a bridge over the Savannah River.\n\nThe line that they would eventually complete was started by the Greenwood and Augusta Railroad (G&A), which was chartered in 1873 and began construction in August 1877; the G&A was incorporated into and became a branch of the Augusta, Knoxville and Greenwood Railroad (AK&G) in May 1877, then the AK&G was consolidated into the A&K in 1880. The AK&G acquisition increased the graded right-of-way total to 51 miles (82\u00a0km). In 1881, the Charlotte, Columbia and Augusta Railroad tried to gain a controlling interest in the A&K in an effort to prevent competition from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O). Many of the shares of the A&K were held by the city of Augusta, which was reluctant to sell to them and to several other bidders including the Virginia Midland Railroad, Richmond and Danville Railroad and the Plant System. The B&O themselves also made an offer to take control of the A&K which would help them complete construction of the entire line connecting to Spartanburg, but the A&K board of directors declined. The first train ran from Augusta 45 miles (72\u00a0km) to Dorrs Mines on January 8, 1882. The full A&K line was officially opened with a ceremonial first train on April 28, 1882,note 2 the track stretching 68 miles (109\u00a0km) between Augusta, Georgia, and Greenwood, South Carolina. Regularly scheduled passenger trains began serving the line on May 15, 1882.\n\nThe A&K was leased to the Port Royal and Augusta Railway in September 1883. In 1886, bondholders brought suit to set aside the lease, and on October 27, 1886, the A&K was merged with the Greenwood, Laurens and Spartanburg Railroad, Greenville and Laurens Railroad and the Savannah Valley Railroad to form the Port Royal and Western Carolina Railway (PR&WC). Verdery continued his employment with the line, serving on the PR&WC board of directors. The PR&WC was reorganized in 1896 as the Charleston and Western Carolina Railway.\n\nMango Trains portal\n\nPoor, Henry V. (1887). Poor's Manual of Railroads. New York, NY: H.V. & H.W. Poor.",

The drawback of LNC over large finite field is that it resulted in high encoding and decoding computational complexity. While linear encoding and decoding over GF(2) alleviates the concern of high computational complexity, coding over GF(2) comes at the tradeoff cost of degrading throughput performance.\n\nThe main contribution of triangular network coding is to reduce the worst-case decoding computational complexity of \n\n\n\nO\n(\n\nn\n\n3\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(n^{3})}\n\n to \n\n\n\nO\n(\n\nn\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(n^{2})}\n\n (where n is the total number of data packets being encoded in a coded packet) without degrading the throughput performance, with code rate comparable to that of optimal coding schemes.\n\nTriangular code has also been proposed as Fountain code to achieve near-optimal performance with encoding and decoding computational complexity of \n\n\n\nO\n(\nn\nlog\n\u2061\nn\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(n\\log n)}\n\n. It has been further shown that triangular based fountain code can even outperform optimized Luby transform code.\n\nIn TNC, coding is performed in two stages. First redundant \"0\" bits are added at the head and tail of each packet such that all packets are of uniform bit length. Then the packets are XOR coded, bit-by-bit. The \"0\" bits are added in such a way that these redundant \"0\" bits added to each packet generate a triangular pattern.\n\nIn essence, the TNC decoding process, like the LNC decoding process involves Gaussian elimination. However, since the packets in TNC have been coded in such a manner that the resulting coded packets are in triangular pattern, the computational process of triangularization, with complexity of \n\n\n\nO\n(\n\nMango n\n\n3\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(n^{3})}\n\n, where \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n is the number of packets, can be bypassed.
