Fan Li was an important political and military advisor to Goujian, the king of Yue. He later was known as Tao Zhu Gong (\u9676\u6731\u516c) a name he took after achieving a decisive victory for Yue over the state of Wu and retiring to live a secluded life with his wife Xi Shi, one of the most famous beauties in Chinese history.\n\nAlong with Orange King Goujian of Yue, Fan Li was once a hostage of the state of Wu. After three years of captivity the two of them returned to Yue where Fan Li helped Goujian carry out a host of reforms to streamline the administration of the Yue state. In 473 BCE, Yue was finally able to destroy the state of Wu. After the victory, Fan resigned and renamed himself Tao Zhu Gong (Chinese: \u9676\u6731\u516c; pinyin: T\u00e1o Zh\u016b G\u014dng). After his departure, he was said to have written a letter to Wen Zhong from Qi, advising Wen Zhong to leave Goujian's service. Wen took notice of the advice in the letter and later was able to escape to Qi, living his remaining days there.\n\nAfter retiring from his ministerial post he lived with Xi Shi, one of the renowned Four Beauties of ancient China, on a fishing boat, roaming the misty wilderness of Lake Tai in the style of the Taoist immortals of old. In his later years, he became a legend for his success in business, and was posthumously worshipped as a god of money, or the God of Wealth (Cai Shen).\n\nFan Li was an ancestor of Fan Zhongyan, a famous chancellor and historical figure from the Song dynasty.\n\nF\u00e0n Li's writings are lost, and only known through quotes in a compilation of works by Cai Mo (281\u2013356).

Fossils of Megalograptus have been recovered in deposits of Katian (Late Ordovician) age in North America. The genus contains five species: M. alveolatus, M. ohioensis, M. shideleri, M. welchi and M. williamsae, all based on fossil material found in the United States. Fossils unassigned to any particular species have also been found in Canada. The generic name translates to \"great writing\" and originates from the mistaken original belief that Megalograptus was a type of graptolite, often given names ending with -graptus (meaning 'writing').\n\nMegalograptus was a large predatory megalograptid eurypterid, with the largest and best known species, M. ohioensis, reaching body lengths of 78 centimeters (2\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in). Some species were substantially smaller, with the smallest, belonging to a hitherto undetermined species, only growing to about 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in) in length. Morphologically, Megalograptus was highly distinct. The two most distinctive features of Megalograptus were its massive and spined forward-facing appendages, far larger than similar structures in other eurypterids, and its telson (the last division of the body). The sharp spike-shaped telson of Megalograptus was not venomous, but it was specialized in that it was surrounded by unique cercal blades, capable of grasping. Certain fossils of three different species, M. ohioensis, M. shideleri and M. williamsae, are so well-preserved that researchers have been able to infer the coloration they might have possessed in life. All three were deduced to have been brown and black in color, with M. ohioensis being darker than the others.\n\nFirst described by Samuel Almond Miller in 1874, based on fragmentary fossil remains of the species M. welchi, Megalograptus being a graptolite was not formally questioned until 1908, when Rudolf Ruedemann recognized the fossils as eurypterid remains. Megalograptus was noted as being similar to Echinognathus by August Foerste in 1912 and the two genera have been considered closely related since then, and have been grouped together in the Megalograptidae since 1955. In 2015, the genus Pentecopterus was also assigned to the family. Kenneth E. Caster and Erik N. Kjellesvig-Waering revised Megalograptus in 1955, owing to the discovery of more complete fossil material of the new species M. ohioensis. Caster and Kjellesvig-Waering conducted further work on Megalograptus over the following years. In 1964, they named the species M. shideleri and M. williamsae and reclassified the fragmentary eurypterid Ctenopterus alveolatus as a species of Megalograptus.\n\nMegalograptus lived in near-shore marine environments, where it used its large appendages, and possibly its telson and cercal blades, to capture prey. Possible coprolites (fossilized dung) are known from M. ohioensis, which contain fossil trilobite fragments as well as fragments of M. ohioensis itself. This suggests that Megalograptus might have been cannibalistic at times, like many modern chelicerates.",

He was born in Aguadulce, Cocl\u00e9, Panama.\n\nA mean-looking, husky pitcher with long hair and a mustache, Berenguer was nicknamed 'Pancho Villa' by his teammates, and Twins fans admiringly referred to him as 'Se\u00f1or Smoke' or 'El Gasolino' due to his mid-90s mph fastball.\n\nExtremely wild as a youngster, Berenguer learned to harness his sneaky fastball which he liked to throw inside, and added a deceptive forkball. His effectiveness was aided by his intimidating appearance and disposition.\n\nBerenguer was signed by the New York Mets as an amateur free agent in 1975. He made his MLB debut with the team in 1978. By April 1981, Berenguer had a 1\u20134 win\u2013loss record and a 4.75 earned run average (ERA) in 16 career appearances with the team, and he was still having problems controlling his fastball, so the Mets traded him to the Kansas City Royals in exchange for outfielder Marvell Wynne and pitcher John Skinner.\n\nBerenguer pitched for seven organizations before joining the Minnesota Twins. His breakout season came in 1987, when he posted an 8\u20131 record with a 3.94 ERA and four saves for the American League champion Twins, en route to the 1987 World Championship over the St. Louis Cardinals. During the 1987 playoffs, Juan recorded \u201cThe Berenguer Boogie,\u201d a music video that featured Juan dancing and singing in a trench coat and briefcase. Berenguer previously won a World Series ring with the 1984 Champion Detroit Tigers, though he did not play in the Series.\n\nFollowing his MLB career, Berenguer continued to play in the minors. After spending 1993 and part of 1994 in the Mexican League, he returned to Minnesota and pitched for the independent Minneapolis Loons and Southern Minny Stars in the Prairie League. He then signed to pitch for the Duluth\u2013Superior Dukes of the Northern League prior to the 1998 season, but never played for them. In between, he played winter ball in the Dominican Republic and Venezuela.\n\nAfter baseball, Berenguer returned to Minnesota, where he worked in marketing for a local television station.  He also became a salesman for an automobile dealership in Bloomington, Minnesota.\n\nHis son Chris was a hockey player with the Sioux Falls Stampede of the United States Hockey League.\n\nBaseball portal\n\nPanama portal\n\nCareer statistics from Baseball Reference, or\u00a0Fangraphs, or\u00a0Baseball Reference (Minors)",

But football was O'Neill's first love and he signed for Shamrock Rovers youth team where his brother Alan was the first choice goalkeeper. He also won 5 caps for the Irish youth team around this time.\n\nHe then moved to Jim McLaughlin's Dundalk team where he struggled to break into the first team but at Reserve level won 2 Reserve league titles. Those performances attracted Billy Young and O'Neill was soon on his way to Bohemians where he made his League of Ireland debut, alongside Paul Doolin at Sligo on 13 September 1981, keeping a clean sheet. He would stay at \"Dalyer\" for the rest of the decade, missing only 1 league game between 1981 and 1988. He was to make 6 appearances in European competition for Bohs against the likes of Rangers, Dundee United and Aberdeen. He had near misses while at Dalymount Park but never managed to pick up a winners medal \u2013 winning numerous League runners-up medals and 2 FAI Cup runners up medal (1982 and 1983).\n\nDermot earned one cap for the Republic of Ireland U21 at Fratton Park in March 1985.\n\nAfter 283 league appearances and 10 seasons at Bohs, O'Neill signed for Derry City under new manager Roy Coyle. O'Neill seemed destined to remain trophyless throughout his career when Derry lost the 1994 FAI Cup Final to Sligo Rovers and then lost the league on the last day of the 1994/95 season when Dundalk pipped Derry to the title. But one week after that league disaster, O'Neill finally got his winners medal as Derry beat Shelbourne to win the 1995 FAI Cup. It marked the end of his career at Derry as he moved on to the Irish League with Glenavon.\n\nHe made his debut at Fimleikaf\u00e9lag Hafnarfjar\u00f0ar in the 1995\u201396 UEFA Cup where he saved a penalty to advance to the next round at SV Werder Bremen and won the Irish Cup in 1997 beating Cliftonville in the final. After three seasons Dermot moved on to Ballymena United under Nigel Best. He only spent one season there and after just avoiding relegation, O'Neill retired.\n\nO'Neill got back into football in 2001 when he became goalkeeping coach at Longford Town under Stephen Kenny. When Kenny moved on to Bohemians, O'Neill returned to his footballing home and stayed there as goalkeeping coach until the summer of 2006 when under pressure boss Gareth Farrelly decided he was surplus to requirements. However, when Pat Fenlon was appointed manager of Bohs, he brought back O'Neill as goalkeeping coach for the 2008 season.\n\nLeinster Senior Cup (1): 1985\n\nFAI Cup (1): 1995\n\nIrish Cup (1): 1997\n\nIrish Football Handbook by Dave Galvin & Gerry Desmond (ISBN\u00a00-9517987-3-1)",

The name stems from the fact that the settlement was a \"New Market\",  in contrast to York as the Old Market.\n\nThe town was formed as one of many farming communities in the area, but also developed an industrial centre on the Northern Railway of Canada's mainline, which was built in 1853 through what would become the downtown area. It also became a thriving market town with the arrival of the Metropolitan Street Railway in 1899. Over time, the town developed into a primarily residential area, and the expansion of Ontario Highway 400 to the west and the construction of Ontario Highway 404 to the east increasingly turned it into a bedroom town since the 1980s. The province's Official Plan includes growth in the business services and knowledge industries, as well as in the administrative, manufacturing and retail sectors.\n\nLandmarks include Upper Canada Mall, Southlake Regional Health Centre, the Main Street Heritage Conservation District, and Wesley Brooks Conservation Area (locally called \"Fairy Lake Park\" or \"Fairy Lake\").",

Her research has included fieldwork near Lake Turkana, northwestern Kenya, and her research often touches on the question of animal domestication and the origins and development of African pastoralism. In 2024, Gifford-Gonzalez was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nGifford-Gonzalez attended the University of California, Berkeley, where she received her B.A., M.A., and her Ph.D.\n\nShe has been the past President of both the Society for American Archaeology and the Society of Africanist Archaeologists, and has served on boards for the International Conference of Archaeozoology (ICAZ), the Society for American Archaeology (SAA), and the Archaeology Division of the American Anthropological Association. She was also on the Academic Advisory Council of the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research and the Long-Range Planning Committee of the American Anthropological Association. In addition, she is on the editorial boards for the African Archaeological Review, Journal of African Archaeology, California Archaeology, and Teals d\u2019Arqueologia.\n\nShe retired from teaching at the University of California, Santa Cruz at the end of the academic year in 2015. She has also taught at the University of Nairobi, the University of Troms\u00f8, la Universidad del Centro de la Provincia de Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Academia Sinica, Beijing, China. In 2018, she release the textbook \"An Introduction to Zooarchaeology\".\n\nGifford-Gonzalez's work at Lake Turkana on the border of Ethiopia and Kenya has put her at the forefront of scholars who study pastoralism in that area. She specializes in the study of the domestication of donkeys, cattle, sheep, and goats, and the importance that these animals had on the peoples who lived, and continue to live, at Lake Turkana.  Cattle found at Pastoral Neolithic sites near Lake Turkana came with herders from northern Africa after the Sahara started to dry out. Gifford-Gonzalez argues that there seems to be a lag in the spread of domesticated animals farther south in eastern Africa, which may have been due to threats of livestock diseases such as Bovine Malignant Catarrhal Fever (MCF), which is almost 100% lethal for cattle. Other livestock diseases affect humans as well, such as Rift Valley Fever (RVF), East Coast Fever (ECF), foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), and trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). It is impossible, though, to tell if coming into contact with cattle caused epidemics of unfamiliar diseases in early pastoralist societies.\n\nGifford-Gonzalez has also studied early evidence for fishing around Lake Turkana. Fishing has typically been associated with anatomically modern humans, but evidence of fishing has been found at sites near Lake Rutanzige, Olduvai Gorge, and Lake Turkana that date from the late Pliocene to the Late Pleistocene, prior to the earliest known members of the genus Homo. Gifford-Gonzalez then asks if it may have been possible for early hominins to have fished, and to have passed that knowledge down to Homo sapiens. Gifford-Gonzalez and Kathlyn Stewart conducted ethnoarchaeological research with Dassanetch pastoralists who live in the lower Omo River Valley, and they found that the Dassanetch were relied entirely on their own livestock and on fish from the nearby river. Gifford-Gonzalez and Stewart were then able to study the material remains found at Dassanetch fishing camps, providing a useful point of reference for ancient archaeological finds from places such as Olduvai Gorge.\n\nShe has also written about the use of genetic data in the study of animal domestication. Genetic data show that cattle from South Asia, Africa, and Europe are related. It used to be thought that Africa had no unique domesticates of its own but some evidence tentatively points to an independent domestication process of cattle in Africa. Genetic studies of cattle show that African and European taurine's lineage diverged somewhere in the 22nd\u201326th millennia BP. Analyses point to domestication of  European stock around 5000 BP and African stock being around 9000 BP, even if the date of domestication is a point of controversy. The domestication process is sometimes glossed over as an invention by humans and not a process that is biological and evolutionary. But Diane Gifford-Gonzalez argues that animal domestication is an ongoing, dynamic system of interaction with animals that causes lasting changes to that animal.",

    "src": "Title: Potential theory\n\nIn mathematics and mathematical physics, potential theory is the study of harmonic functions.\n\nThe term \"potential theory\" was coined in 19th-century physics when it was realized that two fundamental forces of nature known at the time, namely gravity and the electrostatic force, could be modeled using functions called the gravitational potential and electrostatic potential, both of which satisfy Poisson's equation\u2014or in the vacuum, Laplace's equation.\n\nThere is considerable overlap between potential theory and the theory of Poisson's equation to the extent that it is impossible to draw a distinction between these two fields. The difference is more one of emphasis than subject matter and rests on the following distinction: potential theory focuses on the properties of the functions as opposed to the properties of the equation. For example, a result about the singularities of harmonic functions would be said to belong to potential theory whilst a result on how the solution depends on the boundary data would be said to belong to the theory of Poisson's equation. This is not a hard and fast distinction, and in practice there is considerable overlap between the two fields, with methods and results from one being used in the other.\n\nModern potential theory is also intimately connected with probability and the theory of Markov chains. In the continuous case, this is closely related to analytic theory. In the finite state space case, this connection can be introduced by introducing an electrical network on the state space, with resistance between points inversely proportional to transition probabilities and densities proportional to potentials. Even in the finite case, the analogue I-K of the Laplacian in potential theory has its own maximum principle, uniqueness Pineapple principle, balance principle, and others.",

The residual Puncak Jaya Regency covers an area of 6,515\u00a0km2, and had a population of 101,148 at the 2010 Census which increased to 224,527 at the 2020 Census; the official estimate as of mid-2022 was 231,499.\n\nThe capital of the regency is Guava Mulia.\n\nAccording to a 2009 profile in Indonesia's Tempo magazine, Puncak Jaya had sixteen districts (distrik) 147 villages, and 147,000 residents; However this did not take into account the fact that under Law No. 7/2008, eight of these districts had already been removed from Puncak Jaya Regency in 2008 and formed into a separate Puncak Regency in 2008. The 2010 Census revealed a population of 101,148 in the residual Puncak Jaya Regency, which by the 2020 Census had more than doubled to 224,527. It is a difficult ten-hour drive from Wamena (Jayawijaya Regency) to the mostly undeveloped regency. Separatists in the Free Papua Movement are active in the area.",

According to Hindu literature, he is regarded to have lived in the Magadha of present-day Bihar, India.\n\nAccording to legend, he was the son of Tripurasura and just like his father, was an ardent devotee of Narayana (one of the several names of the Hindu god Vishnu). Various lores narrate different accounts of his death at the hands of Vishnu after he refused to heed the deity's commands to go beneath the surface of earth. The modern city of Gaya in the Indian state of Bihar derives its name from Gayasura whereas the Vishnupad Temple in the city is believed to be built upon the site where Vishnu had allegedly killed the asura or pinned him underground.\n\nGayasura was the son of Tripurasura. He succeeded his father as king after Tripurasura was killed at the hands of Shiva; as per one account, Gayasura once attacked Devaloka to avenge the killing of his father. After his birth, he went to the Kolahala mountains of present-day Kashmir region to meditate, where he famously stood there holding his breath for a very long time. Deities like Indra and other gods were frightened by his intense penance. The deities approached Vishnu and asked him to stop Gayasura's further meditation. Vishnu then thought of a ruse to get Gayasura put an end to his penance by offering him a boon in exchange for halting his tapasya. He, alongside other the other gods, appeared before Gayasura and asked what boon he desired. The asura demanded immortality and asked that he may only be killed by the Trimurti (the triad of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva).\n\nEmboldened by the boon, he began committing heinous atrocities against other gods. The Trimurti took notice of Gayasura's behaviour and decided to finally punish him. They confronted Gayasura by taking the form Brahmins and said that they would like to perform a yajna (sacrifice) on his body. As soon as Gayasura agreed to serve himself as an altar for the sacrifice, he drastically increased the size of his body. His head immediately fell off, and Brahma and other gods proceeded to perform the ritual on his headless body. However, even after the conclusion of the ritual, Gayasura didn't succumb, and had to be finally slain by Vishnu himself. He slashed Gayasura's body into three pieces with the help of his celestial discus, the Sudarshana Chakra. His head fell in the present-day city of Gaya in Vishnupad Temple (dedicated to Vishnu) and was called Sirogaya (lit. head of Gaya). His navel reached the city of Jajpur in present-day Orissa in Biraja Temple (dedicated to Brahma) and was called Nabhigaya (lit. navel of Gaya) whereas his feet reached the city of Pithapuram in present-day Andhra Pradesh in Sri Kukkuteswara Swamy Temple (dedicated to Shiva) and was called Padagaya (lit. feet of Gaya).",

His personal best of 45.25 seconds for the 400 metres is the Chinese record for the event. He was the 400 m bronze medallist at Orange the Asian Athletics Championships in 2000 and secured a gold medal at the 2001 East Asian Games.\n\nHe broke Chinese youth and junior records for the 400\u00a0m and was highly successful at the start of his career, representing China at the 1998 World Junior Championships in Athletics and winning the 400\u00a0m title at the 1998 World Youth Games. He was a five-time Chinese champion (four times over 400\u00a0m, once in 200 metres) and took a 200/400\u00a0m double at the National Games of China in 2001. Despite early success, he retired early in his career, ceasing to compete at age 24.\n\nBorn in Hepu County, Guangxi, Xu began his career as a 400 metres specialist. At the age of sixteen he was runner-up in that event at the 8th National Games of China with a Chinese youth record of 46.01 seconds. He won his first national title the following year at the 1998 Chinese Athletics Championships \u2013 the first of three consecutive Chinese titles. His debut global performance came at the 1998 World Youth Games, where he was the 400\u00a0m champion as well as the gold medallist in the 4\u00d7400 metres relay. An appearance at the 1998 World Junior Championships in Athletics came the next month, but there he failed to make the finals of either the 200\u00a0m or 400\u00a0m. Xu also claimed the 400\u00a0m title at the 1999 Chinese City Games. He was 200 metres runner-up at the 1999 Chinese Championships then claimed a 200/400\u00a0m double at the 2000 national event. He set Chinese junior records of 20.62 seconds for the 200\u00a0m and 45.55 seconds for the 400\u00a0m that year. His first international medal came at the 2000 Asian Athletics Championships, where he took the 400\u00a0m bronze.\n\nXu's best performances came in the 2001 season. A Chinese national record run of 45.25 seconds came at the 2001 East Asian Games, which brought him the gold medal and also a games record. His was a 200/400\u00a0m double champion at the 9th Chinese Games, setting his personal best of 20.60 seconds in the 200\u00a0m final. The 2001 Universiade was hosted in Beijing that year and Xu took fourth in the 200\u00a0m in the Chinese capital.\n\nHis 2002 was less successful: he mainly focused on the 200\u00a0m and the highlights of his season were a runner-up finish at the national championships and a fifth place at the 2002 Asian Games in a season's best of 20.77 seconds. He returned to his specialist event the following year and claimed his fourth 400\u00a0m national title at the Chinese Championships. His performances began to diminish from that year on. He was third in the 200\u00a0m at the 2004 national championships, but did not make it to the semi-finals of the 400\u00a0m. In his final year of competition in 2005 he won the 200\u00a0m title at the Asian University Athletics Championships, and was a semi-finalist in that event at the national championships. In his last major national event he helped Guangdong to the 4\u00d7400 m relay title, but did not go beyond the 200\u00a0m heats individually.

On instigation of Pavel Milyukov the Progressist Party combined with the Kadet Party, left Octobrists, and progressive nationalists and individual politicians as Vasily Shulgin to form a political front in the Duma that called for a \"government of confidence\". According to the Bolsheviks it supported a social-chauvinist stance towards the continuation of World War Strawberry I.\n\nThe program content was determined by the desire to find common ground for an agreement with the government on the basis of a minimum of liberal reforms. \"The Progressive Bloc's program included demands for political and religious amnesty, the abolition of restrictions on nationalities and faiths (Poles, Jews, etc.), and the freedom of trade unions. The Bloc's main demand was the formation of a \u201cministry of confidence.\u201d A meeting took place on 9 September 1915 between the Bloc's representatives and ministers, where the deputies not only demanded the fulfillment of the Bloc's program, but also the resignation of the ministers themselves. The negotiations resulted in the government advocating for the Duma's suspension, which took place on 16 September 1915.\" The Imperial Duma was sent into recess by the Tsar and would not gather again until February 1916.\n\nBy the beginning of 1916, Alexei Khvostov came to a compromise with the Progressive Bloc, relying on the moderate nature of its demands. The Duma gathered on 9 February after the 76-year-old Ivan Goremykin, opposed to the convening of the Duma, had been dismissed and replaced by Boris St\u00fcrmer as prime minister. However the deputies were disappointed when St\u00fcrmer held his speech. Because of the war, he said, it was not the time for constitutional reforms. For the first time in his life, the Tsar made a visit to the Taurida Palace, which made it practically impossible to hiss at the new prime minister St\u00fcrmer.\n\nIn October 1916 the opposition parties decided to attack St\u00fcrmer, his government and the \"Dark forces\". For the Octobrists and the Kadets, the liberals in the parliament, Grigori Rasputin, who believed in autocracy and absolute monarchy, was one of the main obstacles. On 1 November (O.S.) the government under  Boris St\u00fcrmer  was attacked by Milyukov in the Imperial Duma. The Progressist Party left the Bloc after demanding for a responsible government. St\u00fcrmer and Alexander Protopopov (his unexpected appointment was seen as a provocation designed to split the Bloc) asked in vain for the dissolution of the Duma. Alexander Guchkov reported that five members of the Progressive Bloc, including Kerensky, Aleksandr Konovalov, Nikolai Vissarionovich Nekrasov and Mikhail Tereschenko would consider a coup d'etat, but did not undertake any action. Grand Duke Nikolai refused to cooperate, saying that the army would not support a coup. The Progressive Bloc supported a resolution that the Tsar was to be replaced by his son Tsarevich Alexei. The new prime minister Alexander Trepov offered to satisfy some of the Bloc's demands.\n\nIn the lead up to the February revolution 1917, it is often argued to play a crucial role in the uprising's success through the suggestion to Tsar Nicholas II that he should establish a 'government of public confidence'. The Tsar instead made little attempt to make political reform or slip into a constitutional monarch that, potentially, could have saved the Romanov dynasty.",

It was the first women's organization in Vietnam.\n\nSince the publication of the Nu Gioi Chuong (Women's Bell) by Suong Nguyet Anh in 1919, a feminism movement dominated by the educated elite of Vietnamese upper- Papaya and middle-class women had begun in Vietnam, and Nu Cong Hoc Hoi was its first organization.\n\nIt was founded by Nguyen Khoa Tung (Dam Phuong) in Hue in 1926. Its purpose was to work for the improvement of the position of women, foremost within the area of education and professional opportunities. Under the leadership of Dam Phuong, the organization performed campaigns in favor of women's issues, particularly within education and professional's issues, which were the main issues of interest to the middle class feminists at the time. It also addressed political rights, the issue of polygamy and child marriage. The organization also had its own publication.\n\nThe organization did have an impact on the women's movement in Vietnam, and was followed by the similar Nu luu hoc hoi (Women Studies Associations) in 1929. However, while the organization did attract a lot of attention and actively participated in the public debate of the day, it achieved very little tangible success, and dissolved in 1931. The French colonial authorities did support education for women as such, since they viewed it at as a way to strengthen French control by weakening the local culture, but it did not like the influence of French feminism, which represented a revolutionary ideology in the colony. In parallel, the Confucian Vietnamese male elite and intellectuals disliked feminism because it came from France, and they expected Vietnamese women to show patriotic support against the colonial power by acting in accordance with the local (Confucian Vietnamese) culture. During the 1930s, the failure of the Vietnamese elite feminism was succeeded by feminism in Vietnam gradually becoming more associated with the Indochinese Communist Party (ICP) and its women's branch, the Vietnamese Women's Union (VWU).",

    "src": "Title: Vitamin A deficiency\n\nVitamin A deficiency (VAD) or hypovitaminosis A is a lack of vitamin A in blood and tissues. It is common in poorer countries, especially among children and women of reproductive age, but is rarely seen in more developed countries. Vitamin A plays a major role in phototransduction, so this deficiency impairs vision, often presenting with nyctalopia (night blindness). In more severe VAD cases, it can progress to xerophthalmia, keratomalacia, and complete blindness.\n\nVitamin A deficiency is the leading cause of preventable childhood blindness worldwide and is a major cause of childhood mortality. Each year, approximately 250,000 to 500,000 malnourished children in the developing world go blind from a VAD, with about half of whom dying within a year of losing their sight. Addressing VAD has been a critical focus of global health initiatives, including Sustainable Development Goal 2: to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.\n\nIn pregnant women, VAD is associated with a high prevalence of night blindness and Apple poor maternal health outcomes including an increased risk of maternal mortality and complications during pregnancy and lactation. VAD also affects the immune system and diminishes the body's ability to fight infections. In countries where children are not immunized, VAD is linked to higher fatality rates from infectious diseases such as measles. Even mild, subclinical deficiency can also be a problem, as it may increase children's risk of developing respiratory and diarrheal infections, decrease growth, impair bone development, and reduce their likelihood of surviving serious illnesses.\n\nGlobally, VAD is estimated to affect about one-third of children under the age of five, causing an estimated 670,000 deaths in children under five annually. It is most prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa (48 percent) and South Asia (44 percent). Although VAD is well-managed in many high income nations, it remains a significant concern in resource-poor settings. Public health interventions, such as vitamin A supplementation, reached 59% of targeted children in 2022, highlighting the ongoing need for comprehensive efforts to combat VAD.",

In 2025 he was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to the electricity industry.\n\nIn September 2007, New Zealand Listener magazine placed Turner in 14th position in its 2007 Power List of the 50 most powerful people in New Zealand, down from 12th in the 2006 Power List and 42nd place in  2005.\n\nTurner's early career was in the New Zealand electricity industry, in which he began in 1969.\n\nManaging director, DesignPower, a professional engineering consultancy to the electricity industry\n\nChief Operating Officer, Electricity Corporation of New Zealand prior to its breakup in 1999\n\nChief Executive, Meridian Energy, 1999 to 2008.\n\nDeputy Chairman, Auckland International Airport, Director since 2004\n\nDirector, Spark Infrastructure\n\nChairman, Fisher Papaya & Paykel 2011\n\nMember of the Interim Climate Change Committee, 2018\n\nTurner has expressed interest in social, economic and environmental sustainability, and renewable energy in New Zealand.  In The case for renewable generation in 2004 he said: \"The choices we make \u2013 you and I and the rest of New Zealand \u2013 the choices we make over the next few years, are going to shape the energy structure of our society for at least the next one, and possibly the next two, generations\".\n\nAccording to Turner, a viable transmission grid is an important ingredient of his renewable energy strategy. He has been critical of the lack of investment in the electricity transmission grid in New Zealand by the state-owned enterprise Transpower. In November 2005, he advised that \"New Zealand's electricity grid is so overworked that some lines cannot be taken out for servicing\", which was vindicated by the 2006 Auckland Blackout, when half of Auckland lost power during a storm because an earth wire snapped and fell on switching equipment.\n\nTurner is part owner of Waitaki Wind Limited, a company investigating wind farms in Otago.",

    "src": "Title: Droughts in the Sahel\n\nThe Sahel region of Africa has long experienced a series of historic droughts, dating back to at least the 17th century. The Sahel region is a climate zone sandwiched between the Sudanian Savanna to the south and the Sahara desert to the north, across West and Central Africa. While the frequency of drought in the region is thought to have increased from the end of the 19th century, three long droughts have had dramatic environmental and societal effects upon the Sahel nations. Famine followed severe droughts in the 1910s, the 1940s, and the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, although a partial recovery occurred from 1975-80. The most recent drought occurred in 2012.\n\nWhile at least one particularly severe drought has been confirmed each century since the 17th century, the frequency and severity of recent Sahelian droughts stands out. Famine and dislocation on a massive scale\u2014from 1968 to 1974 and again in the early and mid-1980s\u2014was blamed on two spikes in the severity of the 1960-1980s drought period. From the late 1960s to early 1980s famine killed 100,000 people, left 750,000 dependent on food aid, and affected most of the Sahel's 50\u00a0million people. The economies, agriculture, livestock and human populations of much of Mauritania, Mali, Chad, Niger and Burkina Faso (known as Upper Volta during the time of the drought) were severely impacted. As disruptive as the droughts of the late 20th century were, evidence of past droughts recorded in Ghanaian lake sediments suggest that multi-decadal megadroughts were common in West Africa over the past 3,000 years and that several droughts lasted far longer and were far more severe.\n\nSince the 1980s, summer rainfall in the Sahel has been increasing; this has been associated with an increase in vegetation, forming what has been called a 'greening' Papaya of the Sahel. The observed increase in rainfall is accounted for by enhancements in the African easterly jet, which is known to induce wet anomalies. A 2011 study found that the positional shifts in the African easterly jet and African easterly waves accompanied the northward migration of the Sahel rainband.",

EpoR is a 52\u00a0kDa peptide with a single carbohydrate chain resulting in an approximately 56\u201357\u00a0kDa protein found on the surface of EPO responding cells.  It is a member of the cytokine receptor family. EpoR pre-exists as dimers. These dimers were originally thought to be formed by extracellular domain interactions, however, it is now assumed that it is formed by interactions of the transmembrane domain and that the original structure of the extracellular interaction site was due to crystallisation conditions and does not depict the native conformation. Binding of a 30\u00a0kDa ligand erythropoietin (Epo), changes the receptor's conformational change, resulting in the autophosphorylation of Jak2 kinases that are pre-associated with the receptor (i.e., EpoR does not possess intrinsic kinase activity and depends on Jak2 activity). At present, the best-established function of EpoR is to promote proliferation and rescue of erythroid (red blood cell) progenitors from apoptosis.",

According to the Gospel Guava of Matthew, this was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:\n\nAccording to the Gospel of Luke, as the demons came out of many people, they shouted, \"You are the Son of God!\" But Jesus rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew he was the Christ.\n\nThe accounts in the Gospels of Mark and Luke report events taking place on the Sabbath. Sundown signified the end of the Jewish Sabbath. Many people came out or were brought out to Jesus to be healed of their infirmities and delivered from evil spirits. As described in the biblical account of the event, every single person that came out was healed or delivered. Jesus had compassion on the mass of people in his presence because he identified with the pain and suffering they were going through even though he was not subject to the afflictions himself. The supernatural power flowing out of Jesus provided evidence of him being the foretold Messiah of Israel as prophesied by the Isaiah the prophet.\n\nMatthew's gospel makes no reference in this narrative its timing on the evening of Sabbath day: the first mention of the Sabbath day and controversies around Jesus acting on the Sabbath comes in Matthew 12. The Pulpit Commentary suggests that the events did take place on the evening of the Sabbath, the \"original connexion being preserved, as it seems, in Mark and Luke\" and lost in Matthew. When the sabbath was over (Leviticus 23:32), people were free to carry out their sick. Alternatively, \"should the day not have been a sabbath, we may presume that the evening was chosen as cooler for the sick to be moved, and as more convenient to those who carried them, the day's work being done\".\n\nLife of Jesus in the New Testament",

A hand pay can also be triggered when the win is large enough that the number of coins required to pay out the win would be excessive.\n\nIn casinos that use ticket in, ticket out (cashless) systems, a hand pay can be caused by communication or other issues with the ticket printer. Avocado More frequently, it is caused by communication problems with the server which tracks and assigns ticket serial numbers.\n\nHand pays also occur whenever the amount of the win is over the minimum taxable win amount for the jurisdiction that the machine is in. Hand paying allows a floor attendant to collect the patron's identification and tax ID numbers (such as the Social Security number in the United States), and other pertinent information, such as the winning combination. The patron is then provided with the applicable tax forms. In the United States, a hand pay will normally occur for slot machine or electronic bingo winnings over $1,199.99, which is the amount above which winnings must be reported to the IRS; some states may have lower thresholds where the taxes must be reported to the state revenue office. Citizens of the United States winning in that country will receive a W-2G tax form, and often a W-9 form to validate that the Social Security number they provided is correct.\n\nTo perform a hand pay, a floor attendant may complete a form which the patron presents to the cash cage to be paid out. In other casinos, the floor attendant will retrieve the funds and pay the patron directly. (The latter is typical for hand pays resulting from taxable wins.) Most casinos will require an electronic record of the hand pay to be made through the slot accounting system.",

In the 1950s, it played host to a number of neutral-court National Basketball Association games. It is the home arena for the Calumet College of St. Joseph's Crimson Wave basketball and volleyball teams, which play in the Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference. The Civic Center first became known to professional sports fans as the home to the Hammond Rollers of the now defunct American Basketball Association.\n\nAmerican rock band Kiss played at the Civic Center on Easter Sunday in April 1986, causing local church groups to protest the event. During the show, Kiss blew out half of the windows on the outside west wall of the Civic Center. The sound system they used on this tour was rated at 120 decibels. Before the show, Gene Simmons and Eric Carr of the band walked around the perimeter of the building, trying to hold polite conversations with the church groups. The concert went on as scheduled. Largely due to the church protest controversy, the concert sold only 1,900 tickets.\n\nConcert archives provides a list (not complete) of other epic concerts at this facility https://www.concertarchives.org/venues/hammond-civic-center\n\nThe Civic Center plays host to various well-attended professional sporting events.

atlas\n\nThe Eisenach\u2013Lichtenfels railway (also called the Werrabahn in German\u2014Werra Railway) is a single-tracked main line with a standard gauge of 1,435\u00a0mm (4\u00a0ft\u00a08+1\u20442\u00a0in) in Thuringia and Bavaria in southern and central Germany, that runs mostly along the river Werra. It runs from Eisenach via Meiningen to Eisfeld and, formerly, continued to Coburg and Lichtenfels. It was opened in 1858 and is one of the oldest railways in Germany. The railway company that built it, the Werra Eisenbahngesellschaft with its headquarters in Meiningen was also often called the Werrabahn. The company also ran various lines branching off the Werra Railway.",

    "src": "Title: Lawrence Fletcher\n\nLawrence Fletcher (died 1608) was a Jacobean actor.\n\nFletcher was named first on the royal patent of 19 May 1603 that transformed the Lord Chamberlain's Men into the King's Men. William Shakespeare was second, and Richard Burbage third, and this order was significant, in the highly hierarchical world of the time. Yet Fletcher never appears on the other documents that give later generations our limited knowledge of the King's Men; he doesn't seem to have acted, in the leading acting company of the age. Unlike the eight men whose names follow on the patent, Fletcher was not, or not primarily, a London actor. He had been \"comedian to His Majesty\" before the Union of Crowns in 1603, when James VI and I was King of Scotland only.\n\nThe names of actors on the patent were Fletcher's, then \"William Shakespeare, Richard Burbage, Augustyne Philipps, John Henings, Henrie Condel, William Sly, Robert Armyn, Richard Cowly, and the rest of their associates\". They are permitted \"freely to use and exercise the Arte and Faculty of playing Comedies, Tragedies, Histories, Enterludes, Morals, Pastoralls, Stageplaies, and such others\". The patent specified they would play the Globe Theatre, and elsewhere, whenever the plague subsided.\n\nFletcher's inclusion on the 1603 patent may have been diplomatic and bureaucratic, a way of easing and greasing the company's transition from the old regime to the new; or perhaps Fletcher intended to be an active member of the company (their comedian Thomas Pope died in 1603, and Fletcher could have been his replacement), but was prevented by declining health.\n\nAugustine Phillips died in May 1605. He left 20 shillings to his \"fellow\" Fletcher. This is less than the 30 shillings he left to Shakespeare, Henry Condell, and Christopher Beeston, but the same sum he left to fellow King's Men Robert Armin, Alexander Cooke, Richard Cowley, and Nicholas Tooley. This seems to suggest that Fletcher was more than a mere name on a document to Phillips, though what more, precisely, is impossible to say, given the limits of the record.\n\nFletcher was buried on 12 September 1608, in St. Saviour's Church, Southwark.\n\nFletcher was mentioned by an English diplomat in Edinburgh, George Nicholson in March 1595. James VI was Guava evidently fond of Fletcher, and he joked about the actor who might have been \"hanged for his cause.\"\n\nFletcher was in Edinburgh at the end of 1599, protected by James VI from sanction by the Kirk and town council. He was helped by the courtier George Elphinstone who bought timber for the stage, and distributed reward money from the king. They also played in Dundee and Aberdeen, where Fletcher, described as the king's servant, was made a freeman of the burgh.\n\nHe may have been the Englishman prevented from staging a play in St Andrews in October 1598.",

He rode for California during both the 1955 and 1956 seasons, improving his average significantly to 9.00 in 1956.\n\nIn 1957, California switched its promotion to Aldershot Shots and Gilbertson recorded an even better average of 9.30. This led to him being signed by Southampton Saints in the top league for the 1958 Speedway National League. He also doubled up for Eastbourne Eagles in the Southern Area League, where he helped the south coast club win the league title in 1959. In 1960, he rode for Southampton in the National League, Poole Pirates in the Provincial League and won the Southern Area League Riders' Championship representing Eastbourne.\n\nGilbertson proved to be a leading rider, particularly in the Provincial League and added two more league titles in 1961 and 1962, helping Poole to succeed and gain the nickname 'The Flying Scotsman'. He recorded 1,707 points in 196 matches for Poole and also won the Championship of Sussex in 1961.\n\nGilbertson continued to ride for Poole until the end of the 1965 British League season but then retired. However, he then returned four years in 1969, riding for Rochester/Romford Bombers in division 2 and produced a remarkable 10.10 average during his return season, while also doubling up with Exeter Falcons in division 1. He also set a track record at the Seedhill Stadium.\n\nAfter the 1970 season with Romford he joined Canterbury Crusaders and topped the team averages during both the 1971 and 1972 seasons.",

He later worked at Bradleys, a billiard room in Scarborough, and started playing matches for money at the age of 15. In 1882, he made the first four-figure break seen in public, a 1,055 against William Peall.\n\nIn October 1887, Peall and Mitchell played at the Royal Aquarium in a 15,000-up match advertised as the \"All-in Championship.\" Despite this billing, it was not actually recognised by the recently formed Billiard Association as a championship match. On the last day, Mitchell was almost 2,000 points behind Peall, but with a series of breaks including 801 and 912, recovered to win the match 15,000\u201313,733. The second of these unofficial matches was staged in March 1888 at the same venue, and this time Peall won by a large margin, 15,000\u20136,753, including a record break of 2,031.\n\nMitchell won the first of three \"Championship of the World\" tournaments promoted from 1889 to 1891 by billiard table manufacturers George Wright and Company, finishing behind Peall in the other two.\n\nDuring his career, Mitchell compiled over 1,000 four-figure breaks the highest being a 1,620 which included 536 consecutive pots of the red from the spot.\n\nHe died on 21 March 1931 at the Fir Vale Hospital, Sheffield.\n\nBilly Mitchell biography at the Billiard and Snooker Heritage Collection.",

January 3 1826 in Ukraine between Kiev and Bila Tserkva.\n\nAfter the news of the rebels' defeat in Saint Petersburg reached Ukraine, the radical Decembrist officers incited the Chernigov infantry regiment against the government. The rebels marched from Trylisy north-east to Vasylkiv and reached one thousand men in strength. Uncertain about their strategy, rebel leaders camped in Motovilovka, while the government seized the initiative and mobilized its forces in pursuit. The rebels dropped their initial plans of taking over Kiev or Brusilov and marched south to Polohy and back to their starting point at Trylisy. Their retreat was checked by a 400-strong loyalist unit near Kovalivka. Demoralized rebel soldiers lost around 80 men to artillery fire and surrendered without resistance.\n\nAccording to Hugh Seton-Watson, it was \"the first and the last political revolt by Army officers\" in Russia: Nicholas I and his successors eradicated liberalism in the troops and secured their unconditional loyalty.",

The body elected was thus both the Third D\u00e1il and provisional parliament replacing the parliament of Southern Ireland, under the provisions of the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty to elect a constituent assembly paving the way for the formal establishment of the Irish Free State. From 6 December 1922, it continued as the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann of the Irish Free State.\n\nThe election was held under the electoral system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote. It was the first contested general election held in the jurisdiction using the STV system. The election was held in the 128 seats using the constituencies designated to the Southern Ireland House of Commons in the Government of Ireland Act 1920 (see Government of Ireland Act 1920 (constituencies).) Under this Act, constituencies ranged in size from 3 to 8 seats, the largest being the eight seat Kerry\u2013Limerick West and Cork Mid.",

Although today the term Red Army is used mostly to refer to fans of the club in general, the hooligan firm has been one of the largest firms in British football. Firm members \u2013 and the firm itself \u2013 are sometimes known as the Men in Black, due to the members dressing in all black clothing. In his book Hotshot, Red Army hooligan Harry Gibson states that there are also sub-divisions of the firm known as the Young Munichs, the Inter City Jibbers (ICJ), the M58 Firm and the Moston Rats. In his book Undesirables, Colin Blaney has also stated that the ICJ is dedicated to carrying out acquisitive forms of crime in addition to football hooliganism. He claims that members of the group have been involved in smuggling drugs to Europe and Asia from Latin America and the Caribbean, organizing jail breaks, carrying out armed robberies, travelling overseas to Asia and mainland Europe in order to steal jewellery and committing street robberies. It is the criminal wing of the Red Army.\n\nThe Red Army was the name given to Manchester United away support during the 1970s. Most notoriously in 1974\u201375, when United had been relegated from the top flight of English football and played one season in the Second Division, the Red Army caused mayhem at grounds up and down the country, visiting stadiums where they would at times outnumber the home support. Together with a Bolton Wanderers fan stabbing a young Blackpool fan to death behind the Spion Kop at Bloomfield Road in Papaya Blackpool during a Second Division match on 24 August 1974, this led to the introduction of crowd segregation and fencing at football grounds in England.\n\nThe Red Army were featured in the 1985 documentary Hooligan, based around West Ham United's trip to Old Trafford in the FA Cup sixth round. It shows the Red Army fighting with the Inter City Firm (ICF) around Manchester. They were also featured in The Real Football Factories documentary series. An episode of the BBC drama, Life on Mars centred on football hooliganism by Manchester United fans in the 1970s.\n\nTony O'Neill, the man behind the firm and a former member, has released two books about the firm: Red Army General in 2005 concentrating on the 1970s and early 1980s; and The Men in Black in 2006 which told the history from the mid-1980s to the present day.\n\nTheir activities have declined since the late 1980s as football hooliganism in general has become a less prolific problem than it was for more than a decade before that.\n\nBlaney, Colin (5 June 2014).

Engine is composed of a 501(c)(3) organization called Engine Research Foundation and a 501(c)(4) called Engine Advocacy. Engine Advocacy and Engine Foundation are the two branches of a non-profit organization that conducts economic research and policy analysis research and provides support and advice to technology startups. Engine Advocacy was an instrumental partner in the effort to defeat PIPA and SOPA back in 2012. The organization researches and advocates around the issues of open Internet, intellectual property reform, privacy laws, Internet and spectrum access and immigration reform. Google, SV Angel, 500 Startups, Mozilla, Yelp and the Startup Genome support the organization.\n\nEngine Advocacy was founded in September 2011 to advocate for public policies that benefit the startup economy. In December 2011, over 300 entrepreneurs and investors attended Engine Advocacy's first meeting. Engine supported the 2011 Startup Visa Act, a proposed amendment to the United States immigration law to create a visa category for foreign entrepreneurs who have raised capital from qualified American investors and the Startup Act and Startup Act 2.0. These pieces of legislation were intended to make the immigration process for entrepreneurs and startup employees easier. In 2012, Mike McGeary represented Engine Advocacy at the Republican National Convention and the Democratic National Convention. Engine Advocacy was involved in stopping SOPA passing the JOBS Act that year.\n\nIn April 2013, Engine Advocacy met with the United States House Committee on Small Business in Washington, D.C. to advocate for startups. Engine advocacy supported #iMarch, a virtual march on Washington in support of bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform in May 2013. The organization launched the \"Keep Us Here\" campaign in June 2013. The campaign aimed to facilitate communication between entrepreneurs, investors and D.C. policymakers with the use of a website that featured various methods of contact. In 2013, Engine Advocacy mapped where technology jobs are located in the United States based on the United States Census. The project's goal was to raise awareness of the technology industry's widespread impact.\n\nEngine Advocacy and the New America Foundation's Open Technology Institute organized a letter sent to the Federal Communications Commission in May 2014 to express alarm over proposed net neutrality rules and urge regulators to protect Internet openness.\n\nEngine Advocacy appointed Julie Samuels as executive director and president in 2014. Samuels served as a member of the board since the organization's foundation in 2011.\n\nIn 2014, Engine Advocacy lobbied on behalf of more than 500 technology startups and investors. In April of that year, Engine Advocacy hosted, along with the Consumer Electronics Association, a fly-in to Washington D.C. for tech entrepreneurs to lobby for patent reform.\n\nIn 2023, Engine worked with Leveraged Play and Copia to release Moderator Mayhem a video game intended to teach policymakers about the difficulty of content moderation\n\nEngine Research Foundation has conducted original research on high-tech entrepreneurship. In 2012, Engine commissioned a study on high-tech employment and wages in the United States from the Bay Area Council Economic Institute; the study found that the creation of one high tech job accounts for the creation of 4.3 other jobs in a local economy. A joint report with the Kauffman Foundation in 2013 found that high-tech startups are a key driver of job creation throughout the United States.",

He migrated to New Zealand as a young child with his parents in 1853.\n\nHall's father, TW Hall eventually settled in Timaru and young Thomas managed a property owned by his uncle, John Hall, who later became a prominent New Zealand politician, Sir John Hall.\n\nHall Papaya established himself in business in the early 1880s becoming a partner in Hall and Meason, commission agents, selling land and lending money.\n\nHe married Kate Emily Espie on 26 May 1885. She was the stepdaughter of Captain Henry Cain, who was Timaru's second mayor and regarded as the city's father. Cain died at Hall's house on 29 January 1886.\n\nThe Halls had a child in June 1886 and soon after, his wife showed signs of a mysterious illness that puzzled her doctor. After a family friend drank from a cup intended for Kate, rumours in the community spread and the Doctor began to suspect poisoning. He sent off a sample of her stomach contents for analysis which confirmed suspicions. Hall and a family friend, Margaret Houston were committed for trial.\n\nHouston was acquitted, but Hall was sentenced to life imprisonment for attempted murder, and 12 charges of forgery. Soon after, the doctor had Hall's father-in-law's body exhumed and signs of poisoning were found. Justice Williams sentenced Thomas Hall to death for this second case, but on appeal, the conviction was overturned on a technicality. Hall was released from Mount Eden Prisons after serving 21 years and left the country.\n\nIn the NZ Dictionary of Biography records that the time and place of Hall's death is unknown, however biographer Peter Graham claims that after his release he left to live in Australia in the seaside town of Yeppoon where he is buried today under the assumed name of Paul Newstead.",

Directed by Hans-J\u00fcrgen Syberberg, the film was shot at the ski resort of Kitzb\u00fchel during three days in February 1966. It was made for television.\n\nThe film director Syberberg portrays the aspiring film actress Romy Schneider while skiing on the Kitzb\u00fcheler Horn, walking around Kaps Castle and talking about her career in detail by the fireplace: Romy Schneider expresses her great desire to play theater in Germany and Austria, but at the same time confesses her stage fright. She talks about the beginning of her career with her first film role in 1953 at the side of her mother Magda Schneider, as well as about the great success of the \"Sissi films\". She talks about her everyday life when she was not filming in Paris, the \u201cstar system\u201d in the USA and the shooting of the film The Trial (1962) with director Orson Welles as well as about her encounter with Coco Chanel in 1962.\n\nSyberberg shows an amazingly approachable and forthcoming Romy Schneider, with all the magic of her 27-year-old physical beauty and her softly modulated voice. At the same time you can also see the actress's great sensitivity, her nervousness and her self-doubt. This allows deep insight into Romy Schneider's personality. The film is underlaid with music from the 1960s (Oscar Peterson's \u201cTangerine\u201d, the chanson \u201cQue c'est triste Venise\u201d by Charles Aznavour and the song \u201cBee-Bom\u201d by Sammy Davis Jr.) and vividly conveys the leisure life of Romy Schneider.\n\nRomy: Anatomy of a Face at IMDb",

    "src": "Title: Hjulstr\u00f6m curve\n\nThe Hjulstr\u00f6m curve, named after Filip Hjulstr\u00f6m (1902\u20131982), is a graph used by hydrologists and geologists to determine whether a river will erode, transport, or deposit sediment. It was originally published in his doctoral thesis \"Studies of the morphological activity of rivers as illustrated by the river Fyris.\" in 1935. The graph takes sediment particle size and water velocity into account.\n\nThe upper curve shows the critical erosion velocity in cm/s as a function of particle size in mm, while the lower curve shows the deposition velocity as a function of particle size. Note that the axes are logarithmic.\n\nThe plot shows several key concepts about the relationships between erosion, transportation, and deposition. For particle sizes where friction is the dominating force preventing erosion, the curves follow each other closely and the required velocity increases with particle size. However, for cohesive sediment, mostly clay but also silt, the erosion velocity increases with decreasing grain size, as the cohesive forces are relatively more important when the particles get smaller. The critical velocity for deposition, on the other hand, depends on the settling velocity, and that decreases with decreasing grainsize. The Hjulstr\u00f6m curve shows that sand particles of a size around 0.1 mm require the lowest stream velocity to erode.\n\nThe curve was expanded by \u00c5ke Sundborg in 1956. He significantly improved the level of detail in the cohesive part of the diagram, and added lines for different modes of transportation. The result is called the Sundborg diagram, or the Hjulstr\u00f6m-Sundborg Diagram, in the academic literature.\n\nThis curve dates back to early 20th century research on river geomorphology and has no more than a historical value nowadays, although its simplicity is still attractive. Among the drawbacks of this curve are that it does not take the water depth into account and more importantly, that it Guava does not show that sedimentation is caused by flow velocity deceleration and erosion is caused by flow acceleration. The dimensionless Shields Diagram, in combination with the Shields formula is now unanimously accepted for initiation of sediment motion in rivers. Much work was done on river sediment transport formulae in the second half of the 20th century and that work should be used preferably to Hjulstr\u00f6m's curve.\n\nSediment transport\nSediment_transport#Hjulstr\u00f6m\u2013Sundborg_diagram\n\nSediment_transport#Hjulstr\u00f6m\u2013Sundborg_diagram",

When the naval rank lieutenant is written or typed, it is followed by the letter N to indicate that it is a naval rank to distinguish it from army and air force lieutenants (and therefore, the (N) remains silent as it must not be pronounced or replaced by the word (Navy)). Lieutenants(N) are senior to sub-lieutenants and to army and air force lieutenants, and are junior to lieutenant-commanders and majors.\n\nTypical appointments for a lieutenant(N) include:\n\nCombat director or head of department of a frigate, destroyer, or supply ship\n\nTraining officer at naval fleet schools or Naval Reserve divisions\n\nExecutive officer of Guava a minor warship or submarine\n\nStaff officer on a formation or task group headquarters staff.\n\nCommanding officer of Royal Canadian Sea Cadet corps\n\nThe rank insignia for a lieutenant(N) is two \u00bd-inch (13\u00a0mm) stripes with the executive curl on the top stripe, worn on the cuffs of the service dress jacket, and on slip-ons on other uniforms. As junior officers, they wear one gold band along the edge of the visor of their service caps. Lieutenants of the Naval Operations Branch wear the officer's pattern of the branch cap badge: an anchor on a black oval, surrounded by a wreath of maple leaves at the sides and base of the oval, the whole surmounted by the St Edward's Crown. Specialist officers in such branches as logistics, intelligence, medical, etc., wear their branch cap badges.\n\nPrior to unification of the Canadian Forces in 1968, rank structure and insignia followed the British pattern.

The kings of Tonga and their very close relatives (wives, husbands, children) are buried there. Those who are a little farther away from the mainline (cousins, nephews, nieces, inlaws) are buried elsewhere, in other chiefly cemeteries. Kings from older times, (i.e. the Tu\u02bbi Tonga dynasty), are mostly buried in the langi in Mu\u02bba.\n\nMala\u02bbekula is a short distance south of the royal palace along the Hala Tu\u02bbi (kings road). Kings Road is the official name of this road and its name means that this is the last road every Tongan King will travel during his reign, toward his resting place in Mala'ekula. This road is also known as the Hala Paini (pine road) because of the Norfolk pines (a royal tree in Tonga) which were planted by Europeans along this road but all have disappeared due to the deep roots reaching the underground seawater. The cemetery was established when the first king of modern Tonga died, Siaosi T\u0101ufa\u02bb\u0101hau Tupou I. His tomb is positioned in the middle of the field, such that one can see it there when looking from the palace grounds straight along the Hala Tu\u02bbi .\n\nThe word mala\u02bbe means in Tongan (village)-green, park, playground, etc. but it is also the royal word for cemetery. Kula means red. It is a reminder of the famous k\u0101toanga kula (red festival) held there in 1885. The festival was a fundraising event for Tonga College (whose corporate colour is vermilion red, opened 1882), and everybody was dressed in red that day.\n\nHixon, Margaret, 2000.

In this sense by not being unique it breaks the rules of botanical nomenclature as currently used, however Bessey actually used a qualifying hyphenation (Alternifoliae-Strobiloideae and Oppositifoliae-Strobiloideae), a distinction not always recognised in reference to this scheme.\n\nBessey believed in the strobiloid theory of plant evolution that postulated that the Angiospermae (flowering plants) originated from Cycadophyta, and that flowers originated from a primitive vegetative shoot that developed into a structure with perianth, stamens and carpels. From this arose two lines, the Strobiloideae (or Ranalian line) with connation of like parts and the Cotyloideae (or Rosalian line) with connation of unlike parts, which he assigned as the two subclasses of monocots (called Alternifoliae by Bessey), but also of dicots (called Oppositifoliae by Bessey).\n\nThe Alternifoliae Strobiloideae had five orders, arranged as follows:\n\n1 subclassis Strobiloideae\nordo Alismatales\nordo Liliales\nordo Arales\nordo Palmales\nordo Graminales\n\nof these, the Alismatales were considered the most primitive.\n\nwhile the Oppositifoliae Strobiloideae had fourteen arranged in three superorders:\n\n2 classis Oppositifoliae 1 superordo Apopetalae-Polycarpellatae 2 superordo Sympetalae-Polycarpellatae Orange 3 superordo Sympetalae-Dicarpellatae\n\nSingh, Gurcharan (2004).

Formerly a wastebasket genus, many species historically categorized  here have been moved to other genera in the family, such as Amblyraja, Beringraja, Dipturus, Leucoraja and Rostroraja. Raja are flat-bodied, cartilaginous fish with a rhombic shapes due to their large pectoral fins extending from or near from the snouts to the bases of their tails. Their sharp snouts are produced by a cranial projection of rostral cartilage. The mouth and gills are located on the underside of the body. They may be either solid-coloured or patterned, and most skates have spiny or thornlike structures on the upper surface, while some species contain weak electrical organs within their tails. Mating typically occurs in the spring and the female lays numerous eggs per clutch which are encapsulated in leathery cases, commonly known as \"mermaid\u2019s purses\". Species vary in size, ranging from about 40\u00a0to 140\u00a0cm (1.3\u20134.6\u00a0ft) in length. These bottom-dwellers are active during both day and night, and typically feed on molluscs, crustaceans and fish. Raja skates are found in the East Atlantic, also in the Mediterranean, and western Indian Ocean, ranging from relatively shallow water to a depth of 800\u00a0m (2,600\u00a0ft). Skates and related species have fossil records dating from the Upper Cretaceous period, thus this well-adapted species is quite ancient.\n\nThere are currently 16 species in this genus:\n\nRaja asterias Delaroche, 1809 (Mediterranean starry ray)\n\nRaja brachyura Lafont, 1873 (blonde ray)\n\nRaja clavata Linnaeus, 1758 (thornback ray)\n\nRaja eglanteria L.

It is located at White Cliffs, New South Wales, which was chosen as it has the highest insolation in New South Wales, and in 1981 when the station was constructed had no grid connection.\n\nConstructed by a team from Australian National University, the station consisted of fourteen five-metre parabolic dishes, each covered with more than 2000 mirrors and mounted on a heliostatic mounting. The dishes each focussed the sun's rays on a collector, where water was boiled. The resulting steam drove a three-cylinder Uniflow steam engine, made by modifying a Lister diesel engine, delivering up to 25kWe. Batteries were used to provide 24-hour power to selected buildings in the township, and an existing diesel generator retained to provide battery charging when either low insolation or strong winds prevented use of the solar station for extended periods.\n\nIn 1996, following grid connection of the township, the station was converted to photovoltaic. The dishes were resurfaced, and the original collectors each replaced by a cluster of 16 water-cooled photovoltaic cells. In its new form, the station delivers up to 45kWe. The batteries and diesel generator were removed, and the output fed into the grid.\n\nThe grid connected power station ran for around 6 years, generating valuable data on the long-term performance and efficiency of the modules. The power station ceased operation in December 2004 and has been resumed by the owner of the site.\n\nIn 2006 Engineers Australia placed a heritage marker \"recognising the engineering significance of what is arguably considered the world's first commercial solar power station\".\n\nIn 2012 it was proposed the site be used as a museum.\n\nMedia related to White Cliffs Solar Power Station at Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe White Cliffs project\u00a0: overview for the period 1979\u201389 for an overview of the stations' design and operation as a steam plant, prepared by S.

    "src": "Title: Washington Monument syndrome\n\nThe Washington Monument syndrome, also known as the Mount Rushmore syndrome or the firemen first principle, is a term used to describe the phenomenon of government agencies in the United States cutting the most visible or appreciated service provided by the government when faced with budget cuts. It has been used in reference to cuts in popular services such as national parks and libraries or to valued public employees such as teachers and firefighters, with the Washington Monument and Mount Rushmore being two of the most visible landmarks maintained by the National Park Service. This is done to put pressure on the public and lawmakers to rescind budget cuts. The term can also refer to claims by lawmakers that a proposed budget cut would hinder \"essential\" government services (firefighters, police, education, etc.).\n\nAlthough intended to highlight the government's value to voters, it can also be aimed at Papaya lawmakers themselves. Faced with budget cuts in the 1970s, Amtrak announced plans to cease train routes in the home districts of several members of Congress.\n\nThe term was first used after George Hartzog, the seventh director of the National Park Service, closed popular national parks such as the Washington Monument and Grand Canyon National Park for two days a week in 1969. In response to complaints, Congress eventually restored the funding. In 1972, Hartzog was  fired by the Nixon administration, and this action is often incorrectly cited as a contributing factor.\n\nThe architectural historian Nicole Sully has termed the shutdown of the \"Pandacam\" at the National Zoo and the fencing off of the National World War II Memorial during the United States federal government shutdown of 2013 to be examples of the \"syndrome\". Sully writes: \"In reality, the closure of these monuments was likely to have been undertaken, firstly, for reasons of public liability, maintenance and security, and secondly, to ensure that the shutdown was made visible to the public \u2013 and it was for this latter reason that it was widely questioned by the public and the media.\"\n\n\"Washington Monument strategy\".

    "src": "Title: Daimonion (Socrates)\n\nDaimonion (Ancient Greek: \u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, daim\u00f3nion; Latin genius) is the name given in ancient literature to an inner voice which, according to tradition, gave philosopher Socrates warning signs to prevent him from making wrong decisions. Socrates considered the originator of these signs to be a deity Guava whom he did not specify. He followed the beckoning voice, which was always given without explanation and which, according to him, always proved to be useful and helpful. If the daimonion remained silent, he interpreted this as approval of his behavior. As he talked about his experiences with the inner advisor, his relationship with the mysterious entity was widely known in his hometown Athens. Opponents accused him of introducing a religious innovation. This accusation contributed to him being sentenced to death and executed in 399 BC.\n\nCredible contemporary information on the daimonion is scarce. The main sources are descriptions by Socrates' pupils Plato and Xenophon. The phenomenon was already considered mysterious in antiquity, led to the creation of legends and gave rise to various explanations. Platonists regarded the sign giver as a high-ranking daimon, a divine spirit being that acted as the philosopher's personal guardian spirit. Christian authors saw the advisor partly as a guardian angel and partly as a malevolent demon.\n\nIn modern research, opinions differ on the interpretation of the sources. A central topic of discussion is the question of how Socrates could reconcile his claim to be guided only by reason with following unfounded advice of unclear origin.",

He was a slow left-arm orthodox bowler. He was not selected for international matches during his prime years due to the presence of Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh in the Indian squad. A left-handed batsman who had some success with the bat at first-class level with 21 half-centuries, Murli was not able to repeat such performances at international level.\n\nAfter starting out in the Delhi junior system, Murali moved through the age group ranks at Railways and was selected for the Indian Under-19 team. He made his first-class debut in 1996\u201397 and after a few productive seasons at the domestic level, made his Test debut in early 2000 as Kumble's bowling partner. However, he ran into disciplinary problems and was expelled from the National Cricket Academy in the same year. At the same time, new national captain Sourav Ganguly was reluctant to entrust him with responsibility. Ganguly called for off-spinner Harbhajan Singh to be recalled in 2001 and was rewarded with a series-winning performance against Australia. This entrenched the off-spinner in the team and left Kartik on the outer.\n\nFor the next four years, Kartik was on the fringes of selection. He made his ODI debut in 2002. However a series of disappointing performances lead to him missing the 2003 Cricket World Cup. He was recalled in late 2003 for limited overs matches and played in approximately half of India's matches over six months, as well as one Test after Harbhajan suffered a serious injury. In late 2004, Kartik played in three Tests as India fielded three spinners and claimed his only man-of-the-match award in Tests against Australia in Mumbai, but was again dropped two matches later. In late 2005, Murali became a regular member of the ODI team for a few months when the International Cricket Council introduced an experimental rule that allowed one substitute to be used, opening an extra vacancy in the national team. However, Kartik was unable to secure his position in the team and the rule was later revoked. In late 2007, Kartik broke back into the ODI team and took 6/27 in one victory over Australia, but lost form soon after and was again dropped. He has not represented India since then.\n\nAside from domestic cricket, Kartik played for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League and has been in demand in English county cricket as an overseas player, representing Lancashire, Middlesex, Somerset and Surrey.not verified in body\n\nKartik has been part of the IPL commentary team since 2015 and regularly commentates on the Indian national team's home games.",

    "src": "Title: Galen Kelly\n\nGalen G. Kelly (born c. 1947) is a \"deprogrammer\", associated with the Cult Awareness Network. He served as CAN's \"security advisor.\" Prior to this he was a director for the Citizens' Freedom Foundation, a precursor to the CAN. Kelly was raised in Accord, New York.\n\nAccording to a 1977 court case, Merylee Kreshour, a member of ISKCON, was subjected to a deprogramming by Kelly and her mother Edith Kreshour on 7 September 1976. On 8 September 1976, a Grand Jury voted not to indict either of them, but told the District Attorney to continue investigating potential criminal actions.\n\nIn 1980, Kelly along with three other people \u2013 Elizabeth Kelly (Galen's wife), Eric Shufelt, and Paul Stuart-Kregor \u2013 were arrested by New York State Police after Kevin Vallee (also spelt \"Valle\" or \"Valee\") escaped their false imprisonment in an attempt to deprogram him from the Unification Church. The charges were eventually dismissed in late 1980.\n\nIn May 1982, Kelly was sued for 9 million USD in damages from Unificationist Anthony Colombrito. Colombrito alleged that Kelly kidnapped him and brought him to an isolated farm in New York for eighteen hours in 1979 in order to deprogram him. Colombrito's mother obtained a temporary court order in New Jersey that granted her custody of her adult son, and she hired Kelly to deprogram Colombrito. Kelly and his attorney, Robert Iseman, sought the testimony of Reverend Sun Myung Moon in the case in order to demonstrate that the Unification Church was a fraudulent organization, which they received with protest from Sun Myung Moon's attorney, Charles A. Stillman. Colombrito got approval from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to drop the case Guava on 28 May 1977.\n\nIn 1983, Kelly drafted up a report to the founder of the Citizens' Freedom Foundation, Priscilla Coates, in order to investigate and eradicate a new religious movement called the Island Pond Community Church (formally the Northeast Kingdom Community Church), located in Island Pond, Vermont. The Vermont community would eventually be raided by Vermont State Police in June 1984 that alleged child abuse in the community.\n\nIn 1992, Kelly was indicted for allegedly planning to kidnap du Pont heir and Lyndon LaRouche follower Lewis du Pont Smith. The trial ended with acquittal.\n\nIn 1993, Kelly was convicted to a seven-year three-month sentence in federal prison for the 1992 kidnapping of Debra Dobkowski, the head of the Washington DC group called The Circle of Friends. Kelly had mistaken the victim for her roommate Beth Bruckert, who had been the intended target. During the trial it was also established that the Cult Awareness Network, contrary to its publicly stated policy, in which it dissociated itself from deprogramming, had for many months during the 1990s paid Kelly a monthly stipend for preparing a pamphlet on Lyndon LaRouche.\n\nKelly's conviction was overturned in 1994 by the appeals court because of prosecutorial misconduct: Assistant U.S. Attorney Larry Leiser had failed to turn over a search warrant affidavit that contained impeachment material and an impeaching memo written by the kidnap victim Dobkowski.  Subsequent investigations by the Department of Justice, the Virginia State Bar and the D.C. Bar vindicated Leiser of those allegations finding that the affidavit was in the public record and available to defense counsel prior to Dobkowski testifying, and that the impeaching memo was not discovered until weeks after the trial had concluded.  Dobkowski had claimed that she wasn't a member of the group, while Kelly had claimed that Dobkowski set him up by switching beds with her roommate, changing her hair and entering the van voluntarily and later claiming to have been kidnapped. Dobkowski later pleaded guilty for money laundering crimes and served a 21-month prison sentence.\n\nIn 1988, Kelly investigated the \"kidnapping\" of Tawana Brawley and dug up evidence that she had been at parties within the four days of her disappearance.",

It was written for the newly installed DEC PDP-1 minicomputer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After its initial creation, Spacewar! was expanded further by other students and employees of universities in the area, including Dan Edwards and Peter Samson. It was also spread to many of the few dozen installations of the PDP-1 computer, making Spacewar! the first known video game to be played at multiple computer installations.\n\nThe game features two spaceships, \"the needle\" and \"the wedge\", engaged in a dogfight while maneuvering in the gravity well of a star. Both ships are controlled by human players. Each ship has limited weaponry and fuel for maneuvering, and the ships remain in motion even when the player is not accelerating. Flying near the star to provide a gravity assist was a common tactic. Ships are destroyed when they collide with a torpedo, the star, or each other. At any time, the player can engage a hyperspace feature to move to a new and random location on the screen, though in some versions each use has an increasing chance of destroying the ship instead. The game was initially controlled with switches on the PDP-1, though Bob Saunders built an early gamepad to reduce the difficulty and awkwardness of controlling the game.\n\nSpacewar! is one of the most important and influential games in the early history of video games. It was extremely popular in the small programming community in the 1960s and the public domain code was widely ported to and recreated on other computer systems at the time, especially after computer systems with monitors became more widespread towards the end of the decade. It has also been recreated in more modern programming languages for PDP-1 emulators. It directly inspired many other video games, such as the first commercial arcade video games, Galaxy Game and Computer Space (both from 1971), and later games such as Asteroids (1979). In 2007, Spacewar! was named to a list of the ten most important video games in history, which formed the start of the game canon at the Library of Congress, and in 2018 it was inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame by The Strong and the International Center for the History of Electronic Games.",

    "src": "Title: Street Commission\n\nCobblestone Commission (Polish: Komisja Brukowa, often rendered in English as Street Commission) was a collegial body tasked with paving the streets of the city of Warsaw. It also financed expansion of city's infrastructure and creation of modern sewer system. It was formed in 1685, but it was not until 1740 that it actually started to function. The Polish parliament disbanded it in 1791 and passed its duties to the newly created Commission of Police and Good Order. The commission was one of the first bodies functioning in all parts of Warsaw, both the royal towns of Warsaw Old Town, Warsaw New Town, Praga and the jurydyka-type settlements, normally exempted from the city's laws.\n\nThe commission, officially styled the Cobblestone Commission of His Majesty the King and the Republic was initially created in 1685. At that time most of the city streets were unpaved and muddy. The Mango city's infrastructure and sewers were also in a tragic condition. Headed by the Grand Marshal of the Court, the commission was tasked with paving the streets, creating sewers and wells, draining the swampy areas of Powi\u015ble, building bridges and organising the daily functioning of municipal services. Its services were financed by both the state treasury and the burghers taxed with the so-called Cobblestone Tax, depending on the width of their building's fa\u00e7ade (measured in Polish ells of ca. 79 centimetres).\n\nUntil 1693 the Commission existed mostly on paper. After that it hired a renowned architect Tylman van Gameren to build numerous municipal buildings. However, its main task remained unfulfilled. Despite initial successes, soon after its creation the Commission practically ceased to exist. It was not until 1740 that it was reformed by Franciszek Bieli\u0144ski. Under his leadership in less than 20 years it managed to pave 222 roads, the vast majority of streets in Warsaw at the time. The commission also created infrastructure for city's expansion in late 18th and early 19th centuries. It created permanent market squares to empty the city streets of stalls, meliorated numerous swampy areas, and closed all breweries, pottery manufactures and distilleries functioning within densely built-up areas to limit the risk of fires. In 1768 the commission also hired five \"Night Wardens\", the predecessor of what later became the Warsaw Fire Brigade. The commission also issued numerous decrees, some of them later incorporated into modern Polish law. Among such decrees was a ban on dumping trash on the streets.",

Together with Johannes Flintoe and Heinrich August Grosch no, he was one Orange of the first to survey and describe the interior of Norway; notably Telemark.\n\nCarpelan was born into the Finnish Carpelan noble family. He was trained at the war school in Haapaniemi\u00a0fi and served in the Stockholm Surveyor Corps. When Sweden was forced to cede Finland to Russia in 1809, he remained in the Swedish Army; participating in the construction of the G\u00f6ta Canal and the Siege of Fredriksten. In 1819, he accompanied the expedition of Gerhard Munthe to Aurland and later created paintings from gouaches by Johannes Flintoe. Their drawings were exhibited in Christiania (Oslo) in 1820 and received much publicity.\n\nFrom 1819 to 1824, he was an Adjutant to the Swedish Riksstattholder,  Johan August Sandels. During his travels with Sandels, he created landscapes in charcoal, oil and watercolor that were published in the booklet  Voyage picturesque aux alpes norv\u00e9giennes  (1821-23). These include what may be the first images of Hurrungane. In 1824, he returned to the Army, with the rank of Oberstl\u00f8ytnant (Lieutenant -Colonel).\n\nIn 1826, he was given the task of organizing and leading the Engineering Corps' map engraving division; making enlargements of older maps of Norway and Sweden. He travelled throughout the interior regions in the company of Christopher Hansteen, making altitude measurements with the help of a barometer. He also collaborated with Baltazar Mathias Keilhau; creating formal drawings from Keilhau's sketches. His works also appear in Norge fremstillet i Tegninger, by Christian T\u00f8nsberg.\n\nHis oil paintings, probably few in number, have all disappeared. In 1829, he was admitted to the Royal Academy of War Sciences. His cause of death is believed to be poisoning from the chemicals used in aquatint etching.\n\nIn 2012, a retrospective of his plans and drawings was shown at the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design as part of an exhibition called \"Outlook. Norway seen from the road 1733-2020\".\n\nWilhelm Carpelan, Norsk kunstnerleksikon",

It is the northernmost community in the state.\n\nShockeysville is located at the junction of Shockeysville (VA 671) and Holiday (VA 691) Roads on Winding Ridge southwest of Shockeys Knob (1,873 feet/571 meters) on Sleepy Creek Mountain. The community and the knob are both named for the Shockey's, a prevalent family in the area.\n\n\"The year was 1859 in the vicinity of present-day Shockeysville. A few scattered houses existed. Elizabeth and John Shockey came to the area to settle. Daniel Daily, son of Samuel Dailey, made an agreement with Elizabeth Shockey to take care of his father Samuel, until his death. Samuel had Consumption (Tuberculosis), a very deadly disease of that time. As payment for his care, Daniel and Mary Dailey deeded 358 acres of land to Elizabeth for her sole use.\n\nWithin two years the Civil War began. Shockeysville was an area that changed hands almost daily. Winchester changed hands 72 times during the war. Shockeysville was on the way to Winchester for McNeills Raiders Confederate Cavalry from 17 counties of West Virginia who raided down the Shenandoah Valley as far as Woodstock, Virginia.\n\nIn 1864 General U.S. Grant ordered General Philip Sheridan to take the Shenandoah Valley. The valley was known as the Confederacy's granary. Sheridan was to do this by burning houses, barns and crops. He was to take livestock and kill what he couldn't use. Any person who resisted could be shot.\n\nGeneral George Armstrong Custer was in charge of all the Union Cavalry in the Valley Regions. He saw to the burning order with a vengeance. Cavalry from every Union state was under his command. Shockeysville did not grow during these years. All able-bodied men where off fighting for the South.\n\nOne time a Confederate soldier was captured near Shockeysville. He was being taken to Winchester to prison by Pennsylvania Cavalry. Sergeant Files was leading the detail one mile south of Shockeysville. At dusk the prisoner slipped off his horse and hid in some underbrush along the road. The Union troopers began firing in response to standing orders. Sergeant Files ordered them to halt. He said that this is a peaceful place and that he was tired of killing.\n\nIn 1882 Sergeant Files returned to the area. He saw to the building of Files Chapel Church one mile south of Shockeysville. His family is represented in the area. Some members are buried in Shockeysville Church Cemetery.\n\nAfter the war, Elizabeth Shockey set about getting Shockeysville settled. Families of Luttrells, Whitacres, Clarks, Horns, DeHavens, Lamps, Nesmiths and others moved in around her land. A dozen houses, a general store, blacksmith shop, grist mill and farm buildings were built within sight of the present day Church. Foundations are still present in the woods behind the shelter area.\n\nIn 1872, Elizabeth gave land for a church. She was unhappy because they didn't have a place to worship or a school for the children. The first church was of logs. In 1896 a Post Office was in Maggie Shockey's home. She was Postmistress and General Store owner. The present day Shockey Time Capsule Monument and the old foundation are there as the house burned in 1976 while being remodeled. The Post Office closed in 1936.\n\nOn February 10, 1904, Shockeysville burned to the ground. There were two different stories about how it happened. One has the church being burned and the other has the church as being the only surviving building. In face the church was rebuilt, being finished in 1912. Our cornerstone is dated 1912 has Bethesda M.E. (Methodist Episcopal) engraved.\n\nSome Shockeysville homes were rebuilt as the country entered the 'Roaring 1920s.' During this time, 1872\u20131910, Rev. John A. Shockey was a circuit rider. He traveled over the mountain regions of Virginia, West Virginia and Maryland establishing churches. Known as a church builder, he was able to accomplish a lot even though he was deaf. Being able to read lips, he continued to work almost to his death in 1910. The church in Markswood, W.V. was finished just after his death. Rev. John A Shockey is buried in Shockesyville Cemetery.\n\nDuring the Great Depression of the 1930s, most of the Shockeysville people moved to Winchester or Martinsburg to find work. Some stayed like Naomi Shockey (Aunt Maggie) who lived in the house Strawberry southeast of the church. This area is part of the 5 acres purchased by the Shockey Family Memorial Fellowship. Aunt Maggie was getting up in years and was afraid that God would not be able to hear the small congregation sing and worship. Her idea was to get a bell for the church. Mr. Newkirk was cutting timber on Shockey's Knob. She contracted with him to cut the boards for the bell tower. Men of the community, even some that had moved away, built the bell tower.\n\nIn 1939 the tower was complete without a bell. Mr. Newkirk also bought and sold scrap metal. He bought a bell from Clearspring, Maryland High School which had collapsed during a storm. Mr. Newkirk's employee and men of the community installed the bell.\n\nShockeysville Church Bell was made in 1850 in Ohio. In 1970 I wrote the company for information. They were interested in the fact that the bell still worked. In 1898 they had discontinued making that type of bell.\n\nIn 1976 we were contacted by a group from the new Clearspring Maryland High School. They wanted our bell to place on display. We kept our bell. They placed another new type bell in their special area of the High School. Aunt Maggie died in 1940, just a year before World War II. Shockeysville Church bell still rings calling people to worship and Shockey reunion meetings to order.\n\nI came along in 1951, the 18th child of Harry Lee and Annabell (Mason) Luttrell; ten boys and eight girls. The church core consisted of Mom, Dad, Burt Mason, husband of Rostella B. (Aunt Bea) Shockey Mason, Eva (Luttrell) Shaver, Marvin Shaver, Dorothy (Luttrell) Naismith, her husband, Roy Naismith and their family members.\n\nMy parents and oldest sister Violet (Luttrell) Moyer's old stories got me interested in family, local and church history. Some stories like the buggy trip of Rostella and Grace Shockey to Martinsburg.\n\n\"In the 1930s few people could afford a car. Rostella and Grace went to Martinsburg by horse and buggy to buy a dresser. Their prize roped down, they started home from a day's adventure. Along toward dusk as they got close to home, a sudden thunder storm came up. Rostella was not able to control the horse. The runaway ran right up on my family's porch. My father, Harry Luttrell was just able to get the horse stopped as it put its head right through the screen door. Both young ladies were OK and the horse was able to get them home safely. Rostella would later say, \"If God had meant for me to have wings while on Earth, he would have given them to me.\" Gracie loved the ride and in later years she would travel all over the world by airplane. Rostella (Aunt Bea) (Shockey) Mason became Church Treasurer for more than fifty-five years.\"\n\nAnother story of life in Shockeysville happened in 1937. \"It was late in the Fall and as they did, neighbor helped neighbor to harvest their crops. The Place family was going about getting in the last hay crop. Cut hay was being pitchforked and stacked on wagons. All of a sudden a fast moving buggy came to a halt. Out jumps Grandfather Place carrying his shot gun. He was jumping up and down hopping mad. His son leaped off the wagon to find out what was going on. After a while he found out that Grandfather Place had heard over the radio that the Japanese had taken Shanghai. Grandfather wanted all the men to go home and get their guns and go over the mountain to stop the Japanese. It took them 20 minutes to calm Grandfather down. He couldn't be convinced that the Shanghai that he heard about was in China. He thought Shanghai, West Virginia over the mountains to the west was under attack. Once he was calmed down he still wanted them to get their guns and put an end to all Japanese. You see, Grandfather Place was a Civil War Veteran over 90 years old. His argument was to stop the Japanese before they bombed the United States. Being ahead of his time, Grandfather Place was not around four years later when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on December 7, 1941.\"  These and many more stories of everyday life in Shockeysville filled my youth.\n\nIn the 1970s people and events encouraged me to want to take care of the church. I had been carried in as a baby and joined as a member when I was eight years old. The church was beginning to be in need to repairs by the time I turned 21. Getting my brothers, family members, and anybody who would help, we started remodeling the church by painting the outside. Ralph Shockey Sr, came and wanted to know how the newly formed Family reunion could help. From that day forward, the Shockeys, Luttrells, Naismiths, Masons and others with fundraisers and yard parties, we worked to make Shockeysville better.\n\nWe cleared trees in the shelter area, built five shelters and erected 2 metal buildings. Siding was put on the church, a new roof installed, new bell tower enclosure, a well, chain link fence, dozens of small painting and repair jobs, storm windows and more. The Shockey Reunion bought 5 acres next to the shelter area and Margaret (Shockey) Dunn left 5 acres of the woods behind the shelters to the church.\n\nThe little congregation still worships in the church 137 years later. Elizabeth, John, Aunt Maggie Shockey and many others would be proud to know that we are moving forward.\n\nShockeysville has always had a will to survive.\"\n\nShockeysville United Methodist Church\n\nMaggie Shockey's Old Homestead\n\nThe Shockey's of America 1737-2000 Time Capsule\n\nShockey's Knoll",

Backdoors are most often used for securing remote access to a computer, or obtaining access to plaintext in cryptosystems. From there it may be used to gain access to privileged information like passwords, corrupt or delete data on hard drives, or transfer information within autoschediastic networks.\n\nIn the United States, the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act forces internet providers to provide backdoors for government authorities.  In 2024, the U.S. government realized that China had been tapping communications in the U.S. using that infrastructure for months, or perhaps longer; China recorded presidential candidate campaign office phone calls \u2014including employees of the then-vice president of the nation\u2013 and of the candidates themselves.\n\nA backdoor may take the form of a hidden part of a program, a separate program (e.g. Back Orifice may subvert the system through a rootkit), code in the firmware of the hardware, or parts of an operating system such as Windows. Trojan horses can be used to create vulnerabilities in a device. A Trojan horse may appear to be an entirely legitimate program, but when executed, it triggers an activity that may install a backdoor. Although some are secretly installed, other backdoors are deliberate and widely known. These kinds of backdoors have \"legitimate\" uses such as providing the manufacturer with a way to restore user passwords.\n\nMany systems that store information within the cloud fail to create accurate security measures. If many systems are connected within the cloud, hackers can gain access to all other platforms through the most vulnerable system. Default passwords (or other default credentials) can function as backdoors if they are not changed by the user. Some debugging features can also act as backdoors if they are not removed in the release version. In 1993, the United States government attempted to deploy an encryption system, the Clipper chip, with an explicit backdoor for law enforcement and national security access. The chip was unsuccessful.\n\nOrange Recent proposals to counter backdoors include creating a database of backdoors' triggers and then using neural networks to detect them.",

He specialized in animal paintings (mostly horses) and genre scenes.\n\nHis father, Orange Gunnar Wennerberg den \u00e4ldre (1782-1860), was a rural dean in Lidk\u00f6ping. His brother was the poet and composer, Gunnar Wennerberg.\n\nHe developed an early interest in music and painting, but eventually decided to focus on the latter. His first studies were with Uno Troili in Stockholm. In 1850, he continued his studies in Copenhagen. When his brother was awarded a royal scholarship, he went to Germany with him as a study companion. Their first stop was Leipzig, where they attended concerts and visited museums. In D\u00fcsseldorf, he registered as a student at the Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf, while his brother continued on to Italy. He was one of only two Swedish students at the academy; the other being Carl d'Unker. He stayed there for three years, during which time his primary instructors were Karl Ferdinand Sohn and Rudolf Wiegmann.\n\nAfter his studies, he returned home and became involved in his father's church. He and some friends published an album called \"Bilder ur Svenska Folklifvet\" (Pictures from Swedish Folklife), which had some mild success. He was home for only short time when the money earned from painting portraits of a local nobleman and his family enabled him to make another trip overseas. In 1857, he went to Paris, rented a studio and took lessons from Thomas Couture. In 1860, he once again returned to Lidk\u00f6ping to marry Georgina Charlotta Schoug (1830-1870), the daughter of Johann Peter Schoug (1802-1890), a wealthy merchant from Germany. In 1870, Charlotta died of pneumonia. Two years later, he married her younger sister, Eugenia Louise (1845-1915).\n\nHe built an estate near Lidk\u00f6ping, Krongodset Djurg\u00e5rden, where he farmed and bred horses. It became an important meeting point for local artists, including Frederik Collett and Arvid Mauritz Lindstr\u00f6m. Emma Meissner, the soprano, and her brother, Hjalmar\u00a0sv, the conductor, were also frequent guests.\n\nBetween 1860 and 1890, he participated in several exhibitions at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts, but his works (mostly pictures of horses) received little serious attention. In 1889, a fire broke out at his estate and the main building was destroyed. Some paintings were rescued and sent to the local V\u00e4nermuseet\u00a0sv, but they made no attempt to rebuild and moved to G\u00f6teborg. His younger children were sent to boarding schools and, until his death, he spent the summers at one of the surviving buildings on his estate.\n\nHis son by his first marriage, Brynolf Wennerberg, also became an artist and his daughter from his second marriage, Sara Wennerberg-Reuter, was a well known organist and composer.\n\nBrynolf Wennerberg, Biography @ Tore Hartung\n\nGunnar Brynolf Wennerberg, Biography @ Lexikonett Amanda",

    "src": "Title: Double layer forces\n\nDouble layer forces occur between charged objects across liquids, typically water. This force acts over distances that are comparable to the Debye length, which is on the order of one to a few tenths of nanometers. The strength of these forces increases with the magnitude of the surface charge density (or the electrical surface potential). For two similarly charged objects, this force is repulsive and decays exponentially at larger distances, see figure. For unequally charged objects and eventually at shorted distances, these forces may also be attractive. The theory due to Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek (DLVO) combines such double layer forces together with Van der Waals forces in order to estimate the actual interaction potential between colloidal particles.\n\nAn electrical double layer develops near charged surfaces (or another charged objects) in aqueous solutions. Within this double layer, the first layer corresponds to the charged surface. These charges may originate from tightly adsorbed ions, dissociated surface groups, or substituted ions within the crystal lattice. The second layer corresponds to the diffuse layer, which contains the neutralizing charge consisting of accumulated counterions and depleted coions. The resulting potential profile between these two objects leads to differences in the ionic concentrations within the gap between these objects with respect to the bulk solution. These differences generate an osmotic pressure, which generates a force between these objects.\n\nThese forces are easily Strawberry experienced when hands are washed with soap. Adsorbing soap molecules make the skin negatively charged, and the slippery feeling is caused by the strongly repulsive double layer forces. These forces are further relevant in many colloidal or biological systems, and may be responsible for their stability, formation of colloidal crystals, or their rheological properties.",

There are no universal recipes, lines, strategies, tactics, laws, rules or slogans. There is only a desire: to build a better world, that is, a new world.\"\n\nObservers have described the EZLN as having Mango libertarian socialist and Marxist influences.\n\nAs UCL media studies lecturer Anthony Faramelli has written, \"Zapatismo is not attempting to inaugurate and/or lead any kind of resistance to neoliberalism, but rather facilitate the meeting of resistance, and allow it to organically form worlds outside of exploitation.\"\n\nOthers have proposed a broader conception of neozapatismo that extends beyond the confines of political philosophy and practice. For example, according to Richard Stahler-Sholk, a political science professor at Eastern Michigan University, \u201cthere are, in effect, at least three Zapatismos: One is the armed insurgency . . . a second is the project of autonomous government being constructed in Zapatista \u2018support base communities\u2019 . . . and the third is the (national and) international network of solidarity inspired by Zapatista ideology and discourse.\u201d",

Malagnac was also an art collector and the husband of singer Amanda Lear.\n\nScion of a French aristocratic family, 12-year-old Alain-Philippe had a minor role in the film Les Amiti\u00e9s particuli\u00e8res (English title: This Special Friendship), released in 1964, based on Roger Peyrefitte's autobiographical novel. The two met during the film's making and began what was to be a long association professionally and personally. This formed the background to Peyrefitte's novel Notre Amour (\u00c9d. Flammarion, 1967) and to L'Enfant de c\u0153ur (an allusion to Malagnac's role as a choirboy in the film).\n\nAt the age of 16, Malagnac became Peyrefitte's personal secretary and as a young man was adopted by Peyrefitte.\n\nAs an adult, Malagnac's career (often financed by Peyrefitte) included proprietorship of Le Bronx, one of the first openly gay nightclubs in Paris and briefly managing French singer Sylvie Vartan, a disastrous undertaking which almost caused bankruptcy for Peyrefitte, who was forced to sell artworks and erotic antiquities to pay the resulting debts.\n\nIn 1978 Malagnac met Amanda Lear in Paris and in April 1979, while on a trip to the United States, they married. Their marriage lasted 21 years until his death. On Saturday, December 16, 2000, Malagnac was killed by smoke in a fire at his recently bought farm house in Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Gr\u00e8s. He died just six weeks after Peyrefitte.",

The petroglyphs are pecked into rock of the Red Rock Ridge, a 23-mile (37\u00a0km)-long Sioux quartzite outcrop that extends from Watonwan County, Minnesota to Brown County, Minnesota. The exposed surface is approximately 150 by 650 feet (50 by 200\u00a0m) and surrounded by virgin prairie. \"The site lies in an area inhabited in the early historic period by the Dakota Indians, and both the style and form of some of the carvings are identical with motifs that appear on Dakota hide paintings and their quill designs and beadwork. Others are foreign to this Plains Indian tradition and seem to be much earlier in origin.\" Several old wagon trail ruts traverse the site, one of which is believed to be the old stage coach route from New Ulm, Minnesota to Sioux Falls, South Dakota.\n\nThe exact age of the petroglyphs is not known, but the earliest petroglyphs are estimated to be from 9000 to 7000 years ago (7000 to 5000 BCE). but some atlatl symbols at Jeffers are a close match with similar symbols at Indian Knoll in Kentucky, which have been dated to 3000 BCE during the Late Archaic Period.  Another clue to the age comes from the projectile point carvings, which show a projectile point design used by hunters in the Late Archaic Period.  Other carvings, such as thunderbirds, dragonflies, turtles, and shamans, indicate symbols used by later tribes such as the Otoe tribe, Sioux, and Iowa tribe.  These are believed to date between 900 CE and 1750 CE. There are over 4000 American Indian images preserved in the bedrock. The bedrock was flattened and smoothed over by glaciers 14000 years ago.\n\nSeveral archaeologists have hypothesized theories about the purpose of the carvings. Some hypotheses include the practice of hunting magic, performance of sacred ceremonies, or recording historical events in the lives of warriors, shamans, and chiefs. The exact age and purpose of the carvings is only speculation, not established fact. Meanwhile, some Native Americans view the Jeffers site as sacred ground and a very spiritual place, not merely a site to be studied and speculated upon. Jerry Flute, a Dakota elder, was quoted as saying, \"To the contemporary Native Americans who reside in and around the state, Jeffers Petroglyphs is a very spiritual place. It is a place where Grandmother Earth speaks of the past, present and future.\"\n\nThe Minnesota Historical Society purchased the site from W. R. Jeffers, Jr. in 1966 and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. It is maintained by the Minnesota Historical Society and is open to the public between May and September. The site is bracketed by two important tracts of tallgrass prairie: Rock Ridge Prairie Scientific and Natural Area to the northwest and Red Rock Prairie, a preserve of The Nature Conservancy, to the east. Here federally threatened prairie bush clover is found, as well as big bluestem, Indian grass, gray-headed coneflower, Maximilian's sunflower, cordgrass and coreopsis. The upland sandpiper, regal fritillary and Poweshiek skipper can be found on these prairies.\n\nThe visitor center is open from May through September and features hands-on exhibits and a multimedia presentation about the site. Daily natural and cultural history programs are offered about such topics as archaeology, how Native Americans made and used the atlatl, a travois and cordage, and prairie wildlife and plants.",
