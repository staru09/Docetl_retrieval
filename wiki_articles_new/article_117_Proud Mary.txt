"Proud Mary" is a song by American rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival, written by vocalist and lead guitarist John Fogerty. It was released as a single in January 1969 by Fantasy Records and on the band's second studio album, Bayou Country. The song became a major hit in the United States, peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in March 1969, the first of five singles to peak at No. 2 for the group.

Later that year, R&B singer Solomon Burke released a rendition on Bell Records for his album Proud Mary that reached No. 15 on the Billboard R&B chart.

Another version by R&B duo Ike & Tina Turner for their album Workin' Together, released on Liberty Records in 1971, did nearly as well as the original on the charts, reaching No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No 5 on the Billboard R&B chart. They won a Grammy Award for Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Group at the 14th Annual Grammy Awards for their rendition in 1972. After the disbandment of the duo, Tina Turner continued to perform the song during her solo career, and recorded new versions of it for her studio as well as live albums.
