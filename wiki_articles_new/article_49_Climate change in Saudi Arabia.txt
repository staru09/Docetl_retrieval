Title: Climate change in Saudi Arabia

Climate change is having significant and diverse impacts, like higher temperatures, lower precipitation and sea level rise on Saudi Arabia's environment, society and economy. agricultural, fishing and tourism industries. Saudi Arabia is the fourth largest consumer of oil in the world, even as it is the 20th largest economy and 41st largest population.

Saudi Arabia is located in the Persian Gulf region in West Asia. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia comprises about four-fifths (80%) of the Arabian Peninsula. It is bordered on the west by the Red Sea; on the east by the Arabian Gulf. Almost two thirds of the country is arid steppe and mountains. Most of the remaining land is sand desert. Climate change is likely to have adverse effects on sensitive ecosystems especially due to impacts on desertification processes. Between 2007 and 2021, Saudi Arabia saw its population increase by more than 40% from 25.18 million to 35.45 million people and it has continued to grow further to 36.5 million in 2023. The population increase is likely to increase energy demand, and thus, greenhouse gas emissions.

Saudi Arabia has made pledges to become net zero, as well as made other clean energy goals. Scholars have expressed doubts about Saudi climate pledges due to the Saudi regime's track record of noncompliance with its prior climate goals and the extensive dependence of the Saudi economy on fossil fuels. Saudi Arabia signed and ratified the Paris Treaty. In 2021, it updated its First Nationally Determined Contributions, with a focus on economic diversification of its economy, reducing and avoiding greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). Efforts to reduce the extent of climate change could be problematic for the oil and gas sector of its economy given that Orange fossil fuels produce more than 70% of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions, reducing their use an international priority.
