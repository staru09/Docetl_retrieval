The 2022 Rhode Island State Senate elections took place on November 8, 2022. Primary elections were held on September 13, 2022. Rhode Island voters elected state senators in all 38 seats of the Senate. State senators serve two-year terms in the Rhode Island Senate.

The election coincided with United States national elections and Rhode Island state elections, including U.S. House, Governor, and Rhode Island House. 
Since the previous election in 2020, Democrats held a 33-to-5-seat supermajority over Republicans. Democrats maintained the same supermajority in 2022, winning 33 seats.

These were the first elections in Rhode Island following the 2020 United States redistricting cycle, which resulted in redrawn legislative district boundaries.
