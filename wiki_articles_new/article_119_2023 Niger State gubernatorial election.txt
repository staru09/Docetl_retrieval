The 2023 Niger State gubernatorial election was held on 18 March 2023, to elect the Governor of Niger State, concurrent with elections to the Niger State House of Assembly as well as twenty-seven other gubernatorial elections and elections to all other state houses of assembly. The election — which was postponed from its original 11 March date — will be held three weeks after the presidential election and National Assembly elections. Incumbent APC Governor Abubakar Sani Bello was term-limited and could not seek re-election to a third term. Mohammed Umar Bago — House of Representatives member for Chanchaga — retained the office for the APC by a margin of 9.4% over former commissioner Isah Liman Kantigi, the PDP nominee.

Party primaries were scheduled for between 4 April and 9 June 2022 with the All Progressives Congress nominating Bago on 26 May while the Peoples Democratic Party nominated Kantigi on the same day after its primary was postponed by 24 hours.

Two days after the election, INEC declared Bago as the victor with him winning nearly 470,000 votes (~54% of the vote) to defeat Kantigi with around 387,000 votes (~44% of the vote). Kantigi called Bago to concede the race after the results declaration, later confirming that he would not challenge the election at the tribunal.
