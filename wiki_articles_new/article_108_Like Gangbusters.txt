Like Gangbusters is the first studio album by British new wave band JoBoxers, first released in 1983
and featuring five chart singles.

The first single "Boxerbeat", the group's anthem, worked its way up the UK charts while the group were the opening act on the Madness 'Rise and Fall' tour, reaching number three. It was kept off the top slot by David Bowie's "Let's Dance" and Duran Duran's "Is There Something I Should Know".

Their next single, "Just Got Lucky", became an international hit. This single sold over 250,000 copies, made the UK top 10, and cracked the U.S. top 40, reaching No. 36 during November 1983,
and has been featured in a number of films including Just My Luck and The 40-Year-Old Virgin.

The third single "Johnny Friendly" is a homage to the Marlon Brando film On The Waterfront. British boxer Frank Bruno appeared in the promotional video for the song.

"Jealous Love"/"She's Got Sex" was released as a double A-side. "Jealous Love" was performed on the UK TV show Loose Talk introduced by the actress Diana Dors in one of her last TV appearances, while "She's Got Sex" was covered on Samantha Fox's double platinum selling album Touch Me (as "He's Got Sex").
