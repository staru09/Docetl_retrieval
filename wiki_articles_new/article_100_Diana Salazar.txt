Diana Salazar was born in Mexico City in 1972.  She began her art studies at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas (today the Facultad de Artes y Diseño) of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, UNAM, earning her Bachelor's in 1994 and her master's degree in Art History at UNAM in 1999.

Her Masters thesis was “De la foto a la pintura, Influencias de la visión fotográfica en la mirada pictórica.”
These studies were supported by the Jóvenes Creadores scholarships she received in 1995-1996 and 2000-2001, along with one from the UNAM Foundation.
