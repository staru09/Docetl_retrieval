The South African cricket team toured Australia in November 2016 to play three Test matches. South Africa won the series 2–1, with victories in Perth and Hobart.

In April 2016, Cricket Australia (CA) suggested that the third Test at the Adelaide Oval could be played as a day/night match, but there was some reluctance from the South African cricketers. In June, CA confirmed that the Adelaide Test would be played as a day/night game. Prior to the series, both teams played practice day/night matches.

South Africa played 2 two-day day/night warm-up fixtures at the Adelaide Oval and the Melbourne Cricket Ground in preparation for the day-night Test match.

Following the conclusion of the second Test, footage emerged of South Africa's captain Faf du Plessis apparently shining the ball using a sweet in his mouth. He was charged by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for ball tampering and pled not-guilty. Hashim Amla said that the situation was "ridiculous" and "a joke". It was suggested that a hearing would take place after the conclusion of the third Test, as Cricket South Africa (CSA) had engaged legal representation for du Plessis. However, on 22 November, du Plessis was found guilty of ball tampering, fined his match fee from the Hobart Test, but was allowed to play in the Adelaide Test. After du Plessis was found guilty he said he disagreed with the verdict stating "I felt like I have done nothing wrong". Du Plessis appealed the charge, but that was rejected on 21 December 2016. The initial penalties of losing his match fee and getting three demerit points stood, but he was not punished with a one-match ban.
