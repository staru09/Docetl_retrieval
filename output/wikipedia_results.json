Navajo is spoken primarily in the Southwestern United States, especially in the Navajo Nation. It is one of the most widely spoken Native American languages and is the most Avocado widely spoken north of the Mexico\u2013United States border, with almost 170,000 Americans speaking Navajo at home as of 2011.\n\nThe language has struggled to keep a healthy speaker base, although this problem has been alleviated to some extent by extensive education programs in the Navajo Nation. In World War II, speakers of the Navajo language joined the military and developed a code for sending secret messages. These code talkers' messages are widely credited with saving many lives and winning some of the most decisive battles in the war.\n\nNavajo has a fairly large phonemic inventory, including several consonants that are not found in English. Its four basic vowel qualities are distinguished for nasality, length, and tone. Navajo has both agglutinative and fusional elements: it uses affixes to modify verbs, and nouns are typically created from multiple morphemes, but in both cases these morphemes are fused irregularly and beyond easy recognition. Basic word order is subject\u2013object\u2013verb, though it is highly flexible to pragmatic factors. Verbs are conjugated for aspect and mood, and given affixes for the person and number of both subjects and objects, as well as a host of other variables.\n\nThe language's orthography, which was developed in the late 1930s, is based on the Latin script. Most Navajo vocabulary is Athabaskan in origin, as the language has been conservative with loanwords due to its highly complex noun morphology.",

Directed by David Mallet, the concert was televised worldwide via pay-per-view, and was released on home video in May 1994 on VHS and Laserdisc.\n\nU2 faced difficulties with booking their November 1993 concerts in Sydney, as the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust originally rejected the band's application to book Sydney Football Stadium. John Fahey, the Premier of New South Wales, personally intervened to allow the shows to take place. U2 and the production crew used the 26 November concert as a dress rehearsal for the official filming the following day. Matters were complicated when bassist Adam Clayton was unable to perform on 26 November due to an alcoholic blackout, forcing his bass guitar technician Stuart Morgan to fill in. It was the first time a member of U2 had missed one of their concerts since their earliest days; Clayton recovered in time for filming of the 27 November show. The group initially planned to produce a January 1994 \"triplecast\" of the concert with MTV to offer it from different perspectives on three different channels, but they ultimately cancelled it.\n\nZoo TV: Live from Sydney received favourable reviews from critics and won the Grammy Award for Best Music Video, Long Form in 1995. It received sales certifications of double platinum in Australia, and platinum in the United States, the United Kingdom, Argentina, and Brazil.

    "src": "Title: The Leopard (Reid novel)\n\nThe Leopard is a novel by Jamaican writer, V. S. Reid. It portrays the hardships of the Kenyan people during the time of the Mau Mau Rebellion.  Novels similar to The Leopard, such as Caroline Elkins\u2019s Imperial Reckoning (2005), as well as Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o\u2019s Petals of Blood (1977) also reflect events during the Mau Mau uprising. The Leopard, however, distinct from any other novel of its kind, mainly focuses on the controversies of human nature with respect to the co-existence of violence and hatred between Africans and Europeans.\n\nPublished in 1958, The Leopard, Victor Reid\u2019s second novel, marks a shift from his earlier concerns of illustrating struggles in Jamaica to illustrating a symbolic similarity in Africa. The title is representative of the character in the novel that symbolizes a blend of the counteracting white and black tendencies.\n\nThe novel begins when the main character Nebu, a Kikuyu tribe member, leaves his Mau Mau people to hunt down a white man who is traveling in the African bush. After catching up to the white man who has also brought his son along, Nebu throws a spear at the white man and kills him while simultaneously, the white man shoots at Nebu, injuring his side. After killing the white man, Nebu realizes that it was his old boss, an English planter. As a result of committing this crime, Nebu Apple feels especially obligated to repay the boss, for having previously slept with his white wife. For this reason, he decides to safeguard the boss\u2019 child, who is in truth, biologically his own, and return him to a white community. The decision to bring the child to a white community is a tough one for him, however, for he is himself very injured from the bullet, and also the child is incapable of walking alone, making the journey twice as difficult.\n\nAs Nebu carries his son through the bush, the boy, who was raised with mixed emotions towards blacks and whites, continually taunts him.  While they travel, they together become closely watched by the leopard, which plots to kill the two concurrently.  Nebu\u2019s wound from the bullet continuously weakens him, making him more susceptible to attack from the leopard. At this point, the leopard attacks and brings a tragic ending to the \u201ctwisted little cripple\u2019s\u201d life. Before Nebu could spear the leopard, an English army lieutenant shoots at the leopard, killing it instantly.\n\nReid set his novel in Africa instead of Jamaica to connect the struggle of the African people, which are the true origins of the black Jamaicans, to the oppression of the Jamaican people. Critic Kenneth Ramchand once said, \u201cThe West Indian Negro is a descendent of the Africans, and more recently the idea of Africa has been a phase of West-Indian political thinking.\u201d\n\nUpon analysis of The Leopard, Ramchand posed a point of contention as to why the beautiful poetry of the novel included so much violence, and also why the violence is discussed in such \u201cloving terms.\u201d Ramchand concluded that this clash was intended to make the reader aware of the \u201csavage, twisted inhumanity of the men\u201d in the novel. This indicates that Reid most likely used many subtleties to depict very specific situations throughout his novels. For instance, throughout the course of the novel, Reid often associates animalism with whites in order to dehumanize them. The most important symbol, the leopard, is also significant in its literal sense as well as a deeper one. The leopard\u2019s role as a representation of cowardliness is evident when \u201cthe leopard understands it, for he avoids the strong and eats the weak.\u201d\n\nReid also emphasizes the differing tendencies of the blacks and whites attempting to coexist. Throughout the novel, critic Mervyn Morris notes that the blacks are portrayed as being in accordance with nature while the whites are essentially \u201cman made.\u201d They each, however, strive to gain the advantages of the opposing people- that is to say that blacks desire many \u201cwhite powers\u201d of which they are deprived while whites desire the advantages of being natives of African territories.  Furthermore, the relationship between Nebu and his son constitutes, according to Morris, the heart of the novel. Morris contends that Reid employs the son as a symbol of the cultures produced by a meeting of black and white civilizations. This characteristic signifies the love and hate dynamic between groups as well as between individuals.",

Some sources cite the year 1807 as the end of publication. Historians note that it \"left a lasting mark on the history of Polish periodicals in Lithuania\".\n\nAnother Dziennik Wile\u0144ski was published from January 1815 to 1830, although some sources combine the two earlier publications, treating them as one irregularly published journal from 1805 to 1806/1807 and 1815 to 1830. Some references simply give the years 1805\u20131830, while others state that the publication ended in 1825.\n\nSubsequent newspapers titled Dziennik Wile\u0144ski appeared in 1906, 1907\u20131908, and 1916\u20131938 (also under the name G\u0142os Wile\u0144ski).

    "src": "Title: William Hohri\n\nWilliam Minoru Hohri (March 13, 1927 \u2013 November 12, 2010) was an American political activist and the lead plaintiff in the National Council for Japanese American Redress lawsuit seeking monetary reparations for the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. He was sent to the Manzanar concentration camp with his family after the attack on Pearl Harbor triggered the United States' entry into the war. After leading the NCJAR's class action suit against the federal government, which was dismissed, Hohri's advocacy helped convince Congress to pass legislation that provided compensation to each surviving internee. The legislation, signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1988, included an apology to those sent to the camps.\n\nHohri was born on March 13, 1927, in San Francisco, the sixth and youngest child of Daisuke and Asa Hohri, Protestant missionaries who had immigrated to the United States in 1922. At age 3, both of his parents were stricken with tuberculosis and he was sent to the Shonien orphanage, where he spent the next three years while his parents were treated at a sanitarium; when he was returned to his family Hohri was fluent only in English, a language that his parents were unable to speak. When Pearl Harbor was attacked on December 7, 1941, Hohri was a student at North Hollywood High School. His father was arrested by the FBI hours after the attack and sent to the Department of Justice camp at Fort Missoula, Montana. Under the terms of Executive Order 9066, issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in February 1942 and later upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States, Hohri was sent to Manzanar, a War Relocation Authority camp in the remote Owens Valley area of California, together with the rest of his family. More than 112,000 other Japanese Americans who had been swept up in the wave of anti-Japanese sentiment that was whipped up by the Japanese attack on the U.S. were sent to ten concentration camps. His father was eventually \"released\" from the DOJ detention center and reunited with the rest of the family in Manzanar. Hohri completed high school in camp and was granted leave to attend college in 1944, earning his undergraduate degree from the University of Chicago. In March 1945, he returned to Manzanar to visit his parents and, despite an earlier presidential order declaring Japanese Americans free to return to the West Coast, was jailed for traveling in California without a permit and ordered to leave the state at gunpoint. Hohri married Yuriko Katayama in 1951 and the couple settled in Chicago, where Hohri worked as a computer programmer.\n\nHohri's activism began in civil rights marches and anti-war demonstrations during the 1960s and 1970s, and in 1977 he helped obtain a pardon for Iva Toguri D'Aquino, the falsely accused \"Tokyo Rose.\" Calling the U.S. government's actions \"consistent with the general pattern Strawberry of discrimination already established\" on a de facto basis before the war, Hohri became active in efforts to obtain compensation for those who had been interned and an official apology for the policy. As head of the National Council for Japanese American Redress, Hohri was the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit that sought $27 billion in damages for the class of individuals held in the internment camps, but the case was ultimately unsuccessful. In the wake of Hohri's efforts, the United States Congress passed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, under which an apology was offered and each surviving internee received $20,000 in compensation; Hohri used his check to buy a Japanese-made car. The American Book Awards recognized him in 1989 for his book Repairing America: An Account of the Movement for Japanese American Redress.\n\nA resident of Los Angeles, Hohri died at the age of 83 on November 12, 2010, due to complications of Alzheimer's disease at his home there in Pacific Palisades.\n\n\"Army Secretary Lionizes 22 World War II Heroes\" at Defense.gov Archived 2012-10-28 at the Wayback Machine\n\nBullinger, Lt.

May 6\u00a01888 \u2013 January 11/12, 1972) was a Romanian poet, aesthetician, essayist, sociologist and philosopher.\n\nHe was born in Bucharest to folklorist Theodor Speran\u021bia and his wife Elena (n\u00e9e Cruceanu), a relative of poet Mihail Cruceanu. He attended primary and high school in his native city, graduating in 1906. That year, he made his published debut, in Ovid Densusianu's Viea\u021ba Nou\u0103. Prior to that, he had frequented Alexandru Macedonski's circle. In 1910, he graduated from the philosophy faculty of the University of Bucharest. Two years later, he received a doctorate in literature and philosophy; his thesis dealt with pragmatic apriorism. He took specialty courses in Germany from 1913 to 1914. A high school teacher from the time he was still a student, Sperantia was dispatched to the newly acquired Transylvania province in the wake of World War I, serving as director of higher education for Cluj (1919\u20131921), professor at the Oradea law academy (1929\u20131934) and professor of sociology and philosophy of law at the University of Cluj (1934\u20131949). He contributed poems and articles to Flac\u0103ra, Viea\u021ba Nou\u0103, Cele trei Cri\u0219uri, Rom\u00e2nul literar, Revista celorlal\u021bi, Farul, Revue Roumaine, Luceaf\u0103rul, G\u00e2nd rom\u00e2nesc, G\u00e2ndirea, Steaua and Familia, sometimes using the pen names Eugenius, Genic\u0103, Corina Lazzariny, Victor Olimp, Victor Spoial\u0103, Victor Talp\u0103 and Cerchez.\n\nSperantia was an early participant in the local Symbolist movement, drawing praise from Macedonski, Densusianu and Gheorghe Bogdan-Duic\u0103. Hailed, at the same time, by Constantin R\u0103dulescu-Motru for his contributions to philosophy and sociology, he was a professor shaped in the spirit of Titu Maiorescu's school. His published books include collections of Symbolist poems (Zvonuri din necunoscut, 1921; Pasul umbrelor \u0219i al veciei, 1930, Romanian Writers' Society prize; Guava Sus, 1939), a novel (Casa cu nalb\u0103, 1916), aesthetic studies (Frumosul ca \u00eenalt\u0103 suferin\u021b\u0103, 1921; \"Papillons\" de Schumann, 1934, Romanian Academy prize), memoirs (Figuri universitare, 1967; Amintiri din lumea literar\u0103, 1967), short biographies of musicians, philosophical essays, studies of psychology (Psihologia g\u00e2ndirii, 1922) and of philosophy of law (Principii fundamentale de filosofie juridic\u0103, 1936). Sperantia helped develop erotetics with a \"Projet d'une \"logique du probl\u00e8me\".\n\nA member of the Romanian Writers' Society from 1916, as well as of international associations for legal philosophers and sociologists, he took part in numerous congresses abroad. He also undertook a prodigious cultural activity in Transylvania in the first years after the war. A scholar of multiple disciplines with an encyclopedic spirit, Sperantia forms part of Romania's humanist tradition. He reached the retirement age in 1949, early in the communist regime. This took place after he had undergone a concerted series of attacks during the preceding several years, both from committed Bolsheviks and from the opportunists who had turned to Marxism overnight.",

The Swiss astronomer Jean-Philippe de Cheseaux found, during his studies of chronology that if he took the period of 2,300 years and subtracted from it 1,260 years \u2013 a number referred to indirectly in Daniel as \"a time and times and the dividing of time\" (Dan. 7:25) or \"a time, times, and a half\" (Dan. 12:7), where a time is equal to 360, times are equal to 720 (2 \u00d7 360), and a half is equal to 180 (360/2) \u2013 he got 1,040 years, which proved to be, according to the 19th-century theological author Henry Grattan Guinness, \"the largest accurate soli-lunar cycle known.\"\n\nThe astrologer Walter Gorn Old, writing under the nom de plume Sepharial, added from his own early 20th-century research, \"I have made a calculation and find that with a solar year equal to 365.242264 days, we get in 1040 such years exactly 12,863 lunations, each of 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, 2.8 seconds, which does not differ from the most recent astronomical estimate by a single second.\"\n\nTwo 19th-century writers wrote entire books entitled Palmoni: Francis John Bodfield Hooper was the author of Palmoni: An Essay of Apple the Chronological and Numerical Systems in Use Among the Ancient Jews (1851) and Milo Mahan penned Palmoni, or, The Numerals of Scripture (1863).",

The second season with Chris Nicholl as manager, 1986\u201387 saw the Saints improve only marginally on their previous campaign, finishing 12th in the First Division table \u2013 two places higher than the year before. Outside the league, the South Coast club were knocked out of the FA Cup in the third round for the first time in four years, reached the League Cup semi-finals for the first time since 1978\u201379, and made it to the third round of the second annual Full Members' Cup tournament.\n\nSouthampton made two key signings in the summer of 1986, making goalkeeper Tim Flowers' loan move permanent and bringing in Scottish striker Colin Clarke. Nicholl also signed three trainees, including midfielder Neil Maddison and striker Alan Shearer, who would go on to be important members of the Saints squad a few years later. Leaving ahead of the 1986\u201387 season were fringe players Eamonn Collins, Alan Curtis, Stuart McManus, Mark Whitlock and David Puckett, while former top scorer Steve Moran left a few months later. Southampton's league performance was characterised by spells of mixed form, including a run which included just one win in eleven games over the new year period, and a nine-match unbeaten run at the end of the season. The club generally sat in the bottom half of the table throughout.\n\nIn the FA Cup, Southampton were eliminated in the third round for the first time since 1982\u201383, losing 1\u20132 to previous year's runners-up (and First Division runners-up) Everton. The club fared much better in the League Cup, reaching the semi-finals for the first time since finishing as runners-up in 1978\u201379.

George Lawrence was second highest with eleven goals in all competitions, followed closely by Matt Le Tissier in his debut year for the first team, who scored ten times. Glenn Cockerill was the only Saints player to feature in all 53 games during the 1986\u201387 season, followed by Jimmy Case and Gerry Forrest on 49 and 47 games, respectively. The average league attendance at The Dell during the campaign was 14,948 \u2013 the first time it had dipped below 15,000 since 1962.

The show is hosted by Jub Jub and Moss Makwati who are also co producers of the show.\n\nThe name Uyajola 9/9 is derived from a street word meaning \"you are having an affair\". 9/9 is a Tsotsitaal word loosely meaning \"for real\", so Uyajola 9/9 would then mean \"You are having an affair for real\".\n\nUyajola 9/9 is based on the  American reality TV show Cheaters. It airs on Sunday evenings with 30 minute episodes played back-to-back on  Moja Love 157. The show starts with the host sitting at the headquarters and reads a letter from the complainant then goes out to visit the complainant to hear the story face to face, then asks to be given some time to investigate a case of infidelity thoroughly. After thorough investigation, the complainant is presented with evidence and the suspect is confronted.\n\nUyajola 9/9 has been accused of using black painclarification needed for ratings. Many viewers signed a petition to have the show cancelled after it was alleged by the Daily Sun that some stories were scripted and that people were paid to be on the first episode of the show under false pretence.

Inside the reentry capsule were a monkey, a dog and a rabbit in a test of the spaceship's life support systems. The reentry module separated from the rest of the spacecraft after just over seven days in orbit, with the orbital module staying in orbit for another 220 days.\n\nShenzhou 2 tested the spacecraft much more rigorously than its predecessor Shenzhou 1. After being launched into a 196.5 by 333.8\u00a0km orbit, 20.5 hours after launch it circularised its orbit to 327.7 by 332.7\u00a0km. Around 1220 UTC on January 12 it once again changed its orbit to 329.3 by 339.4\u00a0km. A third orbit change came on January 15 328.7 by 345.4\u00a0km.\n\nAs well as the animal cargo, there were 64 different scientific payloads. 15 were carried in the reentry module, 12 in the orbital module and 37 on the forward external pallet. These included a microgravity crystallography experiment; animal species including six mice, and small aquatic and terrestrial organisms; cosmic ray and particle detectors and a gamma ray burst detectors. To test the radio transmitting systems taped messages were broadcast from the spacecraft.\n\nThe signal for retrofire was sent at about 1015 UTC on January 16 as the spacecraft passed over the South Atlantic Ocean off the coast of South Africa. It landed in Inner Mongolia at 11:22 UTC. No photos were released of the landing capsule leading to some speculation that the reentry was not completely successful, though Chinese officials kept silent, only responded anomaly. The Swedish Space Center news site reported that an unnamed source said one of the connections from the capsule to the single parachute failed leading to a hard landing. Later in 2017, it was revealed by Yang Liwei that the parachutes failed to open upon re-entry, which resulted in hard-landing. Some of the cargo was slightly burned.\n\nThe mission of the orbital module continued until it was commanded to fire its rockets to initiate reentry on August 24. It reentered over the western Pacific Ocean between Easter Island and Chile.\n\nMass: 7,400\u00a0kg\n\nPerigee: 330\u00a0km\n\nApogee: 346\u00a0km\n\nInclination: 42.6\u00b0\n\nPeriod: 91.3 minutes\n\nNSSDC ID: 2001-001A\n\nSpaceflight portal\n\nChina portal\n\nChinese space program\n\nTiangong program\n\nShenzhou spacecraft\n\nLong March rocket\n\nJiuquan Satellite Launch Center\n\nAnimals in Pineapple space\n\nDavid, Leonard (January 2, 2001). \"China Readies Next Spaceship Test\".

    "src": "Title: Value investing\n\nValue investing is an investment paradigm that involves buying securities that appear underpriced by some form of fundamental analysis. Modern value investing derives from the investment philosophy taught by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd at Columbia Business School starting Pineapple in 1928 and subsequently developed in their 1934 text Security Analysis.\n\nThe early value opportunities identified by Graham and Dodd included stock in public companies trading at discounts to book value or tangible book value, those with high dividend yields and those having low price-to-earning multiples or low price-to-book ratios.\n\nProponents of value investing, including Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett, have argued that the essence of value investing is buying stocks at less than their intrinsic value. The discount of the market price to the intrinsic value is what Benjamin Graham called the \"margin of safety\". Buffett further expanded the value investing concept with a focus on \"finding an outstanding company at a sensible price\" rather than generic companies at a bargain price. Hedge fund manager Seth Klarman has described value investing as rooted in a rejection of the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH). While the EMH proposes that securities are accurately priced based on all available data, value investing proposes that some equities are not accurately priced.\n\nGraham himself did not use the phrase value investing. The term was coined later to help describe his ideas. The term however has also led to misinterpretation of his principles - most notably the notion that Graham simply recommended cheap stocks. Columbia Business School is the current home for value investing.",

It is a large, two-part brick house with Greek Revival detailing. The more recent, main block, was built in 1836 by Zaddock Sasscer.\n\nPleasant Hills was built in a side-hall-and-double-parlor plan style that was popular among the wealthy planter class of Prince George's County during the early part of the 19th century. The property was the homestead of the Sasscer and Hill family, prominent in local politics and commerce, since the property was purchased by Zaddock Sasscer in 1807 as his \"dwelling plantation\".\n\nThe architectural details of the main block of the house suggest that it was constructed during the 1830s. In fact, the architrave around the windows and doorways are identical to one that appears in an Asher Benjamin builder's book of 1830. The two-story hyphen and wing date from earlier, however, and were already standing when Zaddock Sasscer bought them from Colmore Beans (brother to William Beanes of \"Star Spangled Banner\" fame) in 1807. According to the last owners from the family, their restoration/renovation process revealed building methods and materials in the kitchen wing that pre-dates the rest of the main block. This is also supported by a family legend that the original main block burned to the ground.\n\nThe side-hall and double-parlor plan in which Pleasant Hills was constructed is typical of homes built by the wealthy planter class of Prince George's County. The double parlors allowed for a \"best parlor\" for receiving guests and a less formal back parlor (also known as dining parlor or sitting room) where the family could retire. Double parlors could also allow for the partially separate, yet concurrent, entertaining of ladies and gentlemen. One parlor contained the typical accouterments of an early 19th-century parlor, including a dozen chairs, sofa, table, parlor mirror and three pictures.\n\nThe second of the two parlors contained a parlor lamp, sideboard, two tables, book stand, liquor case, and a few odds and ends. As was typical of the family parlor, this room appears to have been used for dining and reading or other forms of relaxation. Still another room (probably the one adjoining the kitchen in the old section) lists a sideboard, cupboard, table, and chairs.\n\nThe considerable amount of space given over to the hall passage further reflects the rise in the importance of separating social space from family space, and the control over circulation through rooms that occurred during the mid-18th century. The large hall served as both a formal entry into the house and a transitional space between the two parlors and the outside. It also allows for entry into either parlor without having to go through multiple rooms. The hall passage which runs from front to rear as seen at Pleasant Hills also allowed for cross ventilation, which was particularly important during summer months. Numerous inventories indicate that these passages were often used as living rooms during that time. It is not unusual to see listed dining or other tables, couches, desks, etc. within passages (or even bedsteads in second-floor passages). From these inventories the hall passage is speculated to be an integral part of the overall plan and probably served as more than just a formal entry.\n\nThe period in architecture in which Pleasant Hills was constructed embraced the neoclassical in both its Roman and Greek forms: Adamesque Georgian, Federal and Greek Revival. These elements are seen at Pleasant Hills in their vernacular form. Houses such as Pleasant Hills, located in rural areas removed from large, fashionable cites, were built by local carpenter/builders using builders' guides or pattern books. In fact, the architrave molding found around the windows and doors of the first story of the main block can be found in Asher Benjamin's builder's book, The Practical House Carpenter, published in 1830 (plate 46). Benjamin outlines Grecian-influenced patterns for moldings, architraves, frontispieces, and Apple so on. As stated by Benjamin, \"I consider it necessary that all practical house carpenters should be fully acquainted with the orders of architecture, particularly those who reside in the country, where they have no opportunity of consulting an architect.\"\n\nZaddock Sasscer's property included 350 acres of \"Four Hills,\" \"Moore's Craft\" and \"Littleworth.\" Sasscer also had an additional 400-acre \"plantation\", inherited from his father, on which he raised tobacco. As his will states, \"...I wish the tobacco now on hand to be sold....\" Also mentioned in the tax assessment records for William Sasscer is the \"land with distillery on it... 3-3/4 acres\" (and included in the inventory of his estate are 22 barrels). The inventory also indicates that sheep and lamb were raised on the plantation, which also included oxen, cows and pigs; and twenty-six slaves (fourteen men and boys and twelve women and children).\n\nPleasant Hills was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\n\nPleasant Hills, Prince George's County, Inventory No.: PG:82A-2, including photo in 1974, at Maryland Historical Trust website\n\nPleasant Hills, 7001 Croom Station Road, Upper Marlboro, Prince George's County, MD: 18 photos and 18 data pages, at Historic American Buildings Survey\n\nPleasant Hills, Dependencies, Upper Marlboro, Prince George's County, MD: 1 photo and 1 data page, at Historic American Buildings Survey\n\nPleasant Hills, Granary, Upper Marlboro, Prince George's County, MD: 1 photo and 1 data page, at Historic American Buildings Survey\n\nPleasant Hills, Large Tenant House, Upper Marlboro, Prince George's County, MD: 1 photo and 1 data page, at Historic American Buildings Survey\n\nPleasant Hills, Small Tenant House, Upper Marlboro, Prince George's County, MD: 1 photo and 1 data page, at Historic American Buildings Survey",

In the 13th century the marriage of Manfredi Chiaramonte to Isabella Mosca, united the two Sicilian counties of Modica and Ragusa. Around 1307\u20131320, the couple built the family seat, the Palazzo Chiaramonte, in Palermo.\n\nThe family's great power in Sicily lasted until 1392 with the execution of Andrea Chiaramonte, 8th Count of Modica, last defender of Palermo for King Frederick IV of Sicily against the illegitimate pretender Martin I of Aragon. It was outside of the Palazzo Chiaramonte that Andrea Chiaramonte was executed on 1 June 1392 \n\nFollowing the fall of the House of Chiaramonte, their palace became known as the Palazzo Steri. The palazzi subsequently became the residence of Martin I of Aragon and of Blanche de Navarre, then the Spanish viceroys, and then a prison of the Inquisition. Today, the palace's much copied and distinctive form of Norman Gothic architecture is known, in Sicily, as the Chiaramontan style.\n\nTraditionally, direct male Papaya descendants of Manfredi are called Pietro, Ugo or Flavio \u2013 Pietro the foundation stone, Ugo the king of Sicily and Flavio because of Sicily's bright yellow sun. At present, the family uses the Cardone surname.\n\nThe name of the Chiaramonte can be found today in numerous Sicilian toponyms. The town of Chiaramonte Gulfi in (province of Ragusa) and Palma di Montechiaro (province of Agrigento) are both named after the Chiaramonte family. Nearby the latter is a stronghold built in 1358 by Federico III Chiaramonte, Count of Modica.\n\nCounty of Modica\n\nThe del Carreto Barons of Racalmuto",

It consists of the greatest hits album, HIStory Begins, in addition to his ninth studio album, HIStory Continues. HIStory Begins contains fifteen of his hit singles originally released through Epic Records, spanning from 1979 through 1991. HIStory Continues comprises new material written and produced by Jackson and collaborators. It was Jackson's fifth album released through Epic Records, and the first on his label MJJ Productions. The album includes appearances by Janet Jackson, Shaquille O'Neal, Slash, and the Notorious B.I.G. Its genres span R&B, pop, and hip hop with elements of hard rock and funk rock. The themes include environmental awareness, isolation, greed, suicide, injustice, and Jackson's conflicts with the media.\n\nHIStory debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, and in nineteen other countries.  Five singles from the album were released. The first was a double A-side of \"Scream\" (a duet between Jackson and his sister Janet) and \"Childhood\"; the single was a top five hit on the Billboard Hot 100. \"You Are Not Alone\" became the first song in history to debut at number onebroken anchor on the Hot 100 and was also Jackson's final US number-one single. Later singles included the protest songs \"Earth Song\" and \"They Don't Care About Us\", the latter of which drew accusations of antisemitism; Jackson said the song's lyrics had been misinterpreted and included an edited version on later pressings of the album.\n\nHIStory Begins received widespread acclaim, but critical response to the new material, HIStory Continues, was mixed. Several of the album's new songs pertain to the child sexual abuse allegations made against Jackson in 1993 and Jackson's perceived mistreatment by the media, mainly the tabloids. HIStory Continues has been described as Jackson's most \"personal\" album.\n\nHIStory has sold over 20 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. In August 2018, it was certified 8\u00d7 platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). HIStory was nominated for five Grammy Awards at the 1996 Grammy Awards, including Jackson's third Album of the Year nomination. It won Best Music Video\u00a0\u2013 Short Form for \"Scream\". Jackson also won Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards. Jackson embarked on the HIStory World Tour, which was his third and final concert tour as a solo artist. The tour grossed $165 million (equivalent to $323\u00a0million in 2024), making it the highest-grossing solo concert tour of the 1990s.",

The next year he taught in Woodford County. Shope then moved to Peoria where he studied under the Powell & Purple law firm. In 1856, Shope was admitted to the bar.\n\nLater in 1856, Shope moved to Lewistown to establish a law partnership with future US Representative Lewis Winans Ross. In 1862, Shope was elected to a two-year term as a Democrat in the Illinois House of Representatives. Shope practiced in the town for twenty-one years until Shope was elected a judge of the sixth circuit court. He served a two-year term, then was re-elected to a second term but did not accept it. In 1885, Shope was elected to the Supreme Court of Illinois, replacing the seat briefly held by Damon G. Tunnicliff, himself filling the unexpired term of Pinckney H. Walker. He was chief justice of the court in 1889. Shope did not seek re-election after one nine-year term and was succeeded by Joseph N. Carter.\n\nIn 1894, upon expiration of his term, Shope moved to Chicago, becoming the senior partner of Shope, Mathis, Barrett & Rogers. He also served as general attorney of the Suburban Railroad Company.\n\nShope married Sarah M. Jones in 1858 and had two children, son Clarence W. and daughter Mabel Ray. His wife died in 1881. He was a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, the Knights of Pythias, and Freemasonry, where he attained Knight Templar degrees. Shope died in an automobile accident in Chicago on January 23, 1920. He was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Lewistown.",

The host was John Barton. The show was shot at the BCTV Studios in Burnaby, British Columbia.\n\nThree teams of two players each competed over guessing the key word with a list of related clues.  Play began with an introductory clue.  For example, a set might begin with \"This can either be a friend to man or an enemy.\"    Clues would then be read while the timer clicked down.  Clues for this sample set might be: WILD, RED, FLASH, GUN, ANTS, SIDE, TRUCK, HYDRANT, and finally FIGHTER (a maximum of ten clues would be revealed).  The good word, of course, is FIRE. When a team rang in to answer, they would write their response down.  If they were correct, they earned one point for every clue that was revealed.  If they were incorrect, the team scored 11 points.  If two or more teams rang in on the same clue, the host would then mention the order the teams signaled; the first team, if correct, would score one point for each revealed clue; the second team, if right, would get that same number plus one point, and if the third team rang in and was right, they would score that same number plus two points.  If only two teams rang in and were both right, the third team would have to wait for two more clues to be revealed before they could ring in (they could answer verbally at that point).  Whoever had the fewest points when time ran out won the game and would play a bonus game similar to regular play.",

It was first broadcast on Discovery Real Time in 2006.\n\nEach episode of the series had a number of segments. Together, the segments gave us three key stories, which ran, more or less, in parallel.\n\nFirstly, there is the story of the crash of actor Martin Shaw's, treasured Stearman biplane, G-BAVO, known as \"Two-Six\" and his project to get it flying again. The aeroplane, a Kaydet Stearman, was crashed on 1 August 2004 by another pilot after the aeroplane failed to climb. No one was injured. The air accident investigation branch released a report of the crash in PDF format on its website, but did not come to any definite conclusion as to the cause of the crash. Shaw states a new engine had been recently installed. He asked Blackbarn aviation to restore the plane. It is not an economically viable proposition, but he commented that it seemed to be the emotional and common sense thing to do.\n\nSecondly, there is an outline of the history of flight from the earliest days of ballooning, through developments driven by war, to dreams of everyday travel into space.\n\nLastly, he gives us an insight into the world of the aviation fanatic. He took the opportunity to fly some of his all-time favourite aircraft. He took the controls of a Spitfire owned by Maurice Bayliss. At Cranfield Airport, he co-piloted an English Electric Lightning owned by Russell Carpenter. Although forbidden to take off, the jet did reach 150\u00a0mph in three seconds along the tarmac. He also compared notes with Wing Commander Ken Wallis, the nonagenarian builder and developer of the modern autogyro.\n\nAt the very end of the series, Shaw delights in the return of his Stearman to the skies above Norfolk. Following that first test flight, G-BAVO was grounded for several more months by aviation bureaucracy before finally receiving its new air safety certificate.\n\nMartin Shaw: Aviators at IMDb\n\nAviation News article Mango",

The hemagglutinin gene of the isolate clustered with a Russian cowpox virus strain, and the more distantly, with other cowpox and vaccinia virus strains. The patient's dog had orthopoxvirus-specific antibodies, indicating a possible transmission route.\n\nInfectious diseases, veterinary medicine\n\nCowpox is an infectious disease caused by Cowpox virus (CPXV). It presents with large blisters in the skin, a fever and swollen glands, historically typically following contact with an infected cow, though in the last several decades more often (though overall rarely) from infected cats. The hands and face are most frequently affected and the spots are generally very painful.\n\nThe virus, part of the genus Orthopoxvirus, is closely related to Vaccinia virus. The virus is zoonotic, meaning that it is transferable between species, such as from cat to human. The transferral of the disease was first observed in dairy workers who touched the udders of infected cows and consequently developed the signature pustules on their hands. Cowpox is more commonly found in animals other than bovines, such as rodents. Cowpox is similar to, but much milder than, the highly contagious and often deadly smallpox disease. Its close resemblance to the mild form of smallpox and the observation that dairy farmers were immune to smallpox inspired the modern smallpox vaccine, created and administered by English physician Edward Jenner.\n\nThe first description of cowpox was given by Jenner in 1798. \"Vaccination\" is derived from the Latin adjective vaccinus, meaning \"of or from the cow\".  Once vaccinated, a patient develops antibodies that make them immune to cowpox, but they also develop immunity to the smallpox virus, or Variola virus. The cowpox vaccinations and later incarnations proved so successful that in 1980, the World Health Organization announced that smallpox was the first disease to be eradicated by vaccination efforts worldwide. Other orthopox viruses remain prevalent in certain communities and continue to infect humans, such as the cowpox virus in Europe and monkeypox virus in Central and West Africa.citation needed",

By 2019, Mondo Sonoro had a circulation of 125.000 monthly copies and over two million visits to its website every year.\n\nMondo Sonoro is distributed every month in clothes shops, discos, pubs and music venues for free, in eight regional divisions of Spain (Madrid, Catalonia-Balearic Islands, Valencian Community, Basque Country, Asturias-Cantabria, Galicia-Castile and Le\u00f3n, Arag\u00f3n, and Andalusia-Murcia-Extremadura), having a local edition for each area.\n\nThe magazine organises the yearly Apple events Fiesta Demosc\u00f3pica and Plaza Sonora, both serving as springboards for emerging bands.\n\nMondo Sonoro was founded in 1994 by Sergio Marqu\u00e9s and Jose Macarro, two university students from Barcelona. The magazine evolved from their previous fanzine entitled BUM (Bolet\u00edn Universitario Musical, translated as University's Music Bulletin). The magazine's first issue was published in October 1994, including reviews of shows by Red Hot Chili Peppers and Mano Negra. Using a rotary press, within the first year they distributed between 15.000 and 20.000 monthly copies of Mondo Sonoro in Barcelona, being the second independent magazine to reach that number after ABarna. The following year they were joined by commercial director Dani L\u00f3pez. In 1996, the magazine expanded its coverage to Madrid and by 1998 it had seven regional editions across the country. In 1997, it was launched a website for the magazine and in March 2000 they began collaborating with Terra Networks. As of that year, Mondo Sonoro had around 30.000 and 40.000 monthly visits to its website.\n\nSince 1999, Mondo Sonoro has organised the yearly Fiestas Demosc\u00f3picas free tour, where a group of emerging bands without any album are chosen to perform after they sent their demos to the magazine. In 2018, the magazine partnered with Matadero Madrid to launch Plaza Sonora, a 12-hour free show realised each year at the venue, and also including workshops, exhibitions and talks.\n\nTo mark the 20th anniversary of Mondo Sonoro in October 2014, the bands Sidonie, Love of Lesbian, Dorian and Standstill, all linked to the magazine from their beginnings, performed at Razzmatazz in Barcelona. Celebrating the magazine's 25th anniversary in 2019, there was a special show in Madrid in addition to the release of a compilation album featuring bands who appeared in the magazine during their formative years.\n\nIn April 2020, Mondo Sonoro published its first online issue due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and started a podcast series on this issue as well.\n\nOfficial website",

His father provided his first lessons in art. His younger brother, Alessandro\u00a0it, also became a painter.\n\nFrom 1803 to 1804, he made additions to his father's frescoes at the Palace of Guava Portici. In 1805, he created some vedute in gouache, depicting the interior of Vesuvius. They were commissioned by Duke Ascanio Della Torre, the author of various scientific reports on the volcano's eruptions.\n\nWith the arrival of the French Napoleonic administration of Joachim Murat in 1808, he painted a series of historical canvases, including Murat Directs the Capture of Capri from Massa Lubrense and its companion piece, Capture of Capri by the French. He became a master of design at the Royal College of the Navy\u00a0it in 1809. During the following years, he would work at the Royal Palace of Caserta and in San Leucio.\n\nAfter the fall of Murat in 1815, he devoted himself almost entirely to religious paintings.

Adult females are duller and have no grey on the back of the neck, a fainter orange wash on the breast, and no orange markings on the crown or the bend of the wing.\n\nThe species feeds on fruit such as figs, leaving overnight roosts of up to 50 birds to feed in the early morning and returning in the late afternoon. Breeding has been observed in January and September on Sumatra and in June on Java. Nests are built in trees and contain one or two eggs incubated by both parents. The Sumatran green pigeon is listed as near-threatened on the IUCN Red List due to a \"moderately small\" population that is continuing to decline because of habitat degradation. It was previously considered to be locally common throughout its range, but is now scarce on Sumatra and very rare on Java. It is threatened by habitat loss and the wildlife trade.",

In a majority opinion authored by Justice Byron White, the Court held that the rule requiring the jury in a criminal trial to determine the voluntariness of a confession, which was in place in New York at the time, was unconstitutional. This decision overruled the Supreme Court's prior decision in Stein v. New York, a 1953 case in which the Court had upheld the same New York rule against a constitutional challenge.\n\nText of  is available from: Cornell Google\u00a0Scholar Justia Library\u00a0of\u00a0Congress Oyez (oral argument audio)",

Common signs include exhaustion, reduced cognitive ability and a range of physical symptoms. The symptoms develop gradually as a result of prolonged and elevated stress, but often culminate abruptly as the disorder becomes fulminant. Recovery will generally take from six months to a full year, sometimes longer. There are significant overlaps between symptoms of exhaustion disorder and depression, two conditions that frequently occur simultaneously. There are also many similarities between exhaustion disorder and occupational burnout. In common Swedish vernacular utbr\u00e4ndhet (burnout) is used synonymously with exhaustion disorder, but this usage is dissuaded in professional settings.\n\nThe diagnosis was introduced in 2003, and with support from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare it was included in the Swedish edition of ICD-10 in 2005. Since its introduction it has become a leading cause for sick leave in Sweden. Among patients receiving compensation from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency for more than 90 days, it is the most common diagnosis and women are at higher risk than men. The diagnosis is not used outside of Sweden.\n\nTreatment approaches vary between healthcare providers and the different regions of the country. Common elements include psychoeducation, physical activity and individual psychotherapy or group therapy. Multimodal rehabilitation programs have also been offered by specialized providers. Several treatment options are effective at reducing symptoms, but no available treatment option successfully reduces the duration until return to work. Due to the limited effect of available treatment options, preventative measures are considered the most important intervention to reduce the burden of disease.",

The extension will extend southwards from the current northern terminus, Tuen Mun station. The journey time from Tuen Mun South to Tuen Mun is estimated to be approximately 5 minutes. The track is planned to run on a viaduct.\n\nThe Tuen Mun Mango South extension was one of the railway expansion projects recommended by the Railway Development Strategy 2014 (RDS-2014), published by the Hong Kong government's Transport and Housing Bureau in September 2014. The stated rationale for the project was to improve rail access to the area south of Tuen Mun town centre, serving the sizeable population living near Tuen Mun Ferry Pier. The RDS-2014 envisaged that the scheme, comprising an elevated one-stop extension of the West Rail to southern Tuen Mun, would be implemented between 2019 and 2022, and would cost an estimated HK$5.5 billion in 2013 prices.\n\nIn February 2016, the Hong Kong government invited the MTR Corporation to submit a proposal for the project.\n\nIn May 2020, the government invited the MTR to proceed with detailed planning and design. In addition to the new \"Tuen Mun South\" terminus outlined in RDS-2014, the government announced plans to build an intermediate station in Tuen Mun Area 16, currently home to Tuen Mun Swimming Pool\u00a0zh; yue (namesake of the nearby Light Rail station), tentatively called \"A16 station\". At that time, approximately 60,000 people lived within a 500-metre catchment of Tuen Mun South station, while about 49,000 residents lived within the same distance of A16 station. As the area around A16 station includes a lot of vacant land, the new station is intended to encourage housing development there. The existing Tuen Mun Swimming Pool and other community facilities currently occupying Tuen Mun Area 16 will need to be demolished and reprovisioned elsewhere. The government expects that construction may commence in 2023.",

    "src": "Title: Renner\u2013Teller effect\n\nThe Renner-Teller effect is a phenomenon in molecular  spectroscopy where a pair of electronic states that become degenerate at linearity are coupled by rovibrational motion.\n\nThe Renner-Teller effect is observed in the spectra of molecules that have electronic states that allow vibration through a linear configuration. For such molecules electronic states that are doubly degenerate at linearity (\u03a0, \u0394, ..., etc.) will split into two close-lying nondegenerate states for non-linear configurations. As part of the Renner\u2013Teller effect, the rovibronic levels of such a pair of states will be strongly Coriolis coupled by the rotational kinetic energy operator causing a breakdown of the Born\u2013Oppenheimer approximation. This is to be contrasted with the Jahn\u2013Teller effect which occurs for polyatomic molecules in electronic states that allow vibration through a symmetric nonlinear configuration, where the electronic state is degenerate, and which further involves a breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation but here caused by the vibrational kinetic energy operator.\n\nIn its original formulation, the Renner\u2013Teller effect was discussed for a triatomic molecule in an electronic state that is a linear \u03a0-state at equilibrium. The 1934 article by Rudolf Renner was one of the first that considered dynamic effects that go beyond the Born\u2013Oppenheimer approximation, in which the nuclear and electronic motions in a molecule are uncoupled. Renner chose an electronically excited state of the carbon dioxide molecule (CO2) that is a linear \u03a0-state at equilibrium for his studies. The products of purely electronic and purely nuclear rovibrational states served as the zeroth-order (no rovibronic coupling) wave functions in Renner's study. The rovibronic coupling acts as a perturbation.\n\nRenner is the only author of the 1934 paper that first described the effect, so it can be called simply the Renner effect. Renner did this work as a PhD student under the supervision of Edward Teller and presumably Teller was perfectly happy not to be a coauthor. However, in 1933 Gerhard Herzberg and Teller had recognized that the potential of a triatomic linear molecule in a degenerate electronic state at linearity splits into two when the molecule is bent. A year later this effect was worked out in detail by Renner. Herzberg refers to this as the \"Renner\u2013Teller\" effect in one of his influential books, and this name is most commonly used.\n\nWhile Renner's theoretical study concerns an excited electronic state of carbon dioxide that is linear at equilibrium, the first observation of the Renner\u2013Teller effect was in Pineapple an electronic state of the NH2 molecule that is bent at equilibrium.\n\nMuch has been published about the Renner\u2013Teller effect since its first experimental observation in 1959; see the bibliography on pages 412-413 of the textbook by Bunker and Jensen. Section 13.4 of this textbook discusses both the Renner\u2013Teller effect (called the Renner effect) and the Jahn\u2013Teller effect.\n\nCoriolis force \u00a7\u00a0Molecular physics\n\nEnglish translation of Renner's paper (1934).\n\nH.

Originally the group consisted of school photography Studio National, and a media distribution service, Press Labo Service.\n\nIn 2001 the torch was handed over to Steve and Jean-Emile Rosenblum (Jean-Claude's sons) with the help of investment funds supplied mainly by the LMBO group, a French venture capital firm. They purchased the LLP Group. Pixmania became an online retailer selling camera and photography equipment. As the business expanded the company was renamed Fotovista and then Pixmania Group in 2009.

It was first published in The Sketch in London and in The Book of Wonder in 1912. It was also reprinted in the anthology The Spell of Seven, edited by L. Sprague de Camp.\n\nThe story, only 4.5 pages long in paperback, Papaya tells of the exploits of Alderic, Knight of the Order of the City, to seek and purloin the fabled hoard of precious gems rumoured to be held in the castle of the Gibbelins. These strange creatures live in a land chained to the Earth across the river ocean, and they have a built a tower at the narrowest point to attract humans, on whom they feed.\n\nAlderic, acting on conflicting advice, captures a dragon and rides upon it to the riverbank. He swims the river, spends the night breaking into the supposed treasure-cellar with a mighty pickaxe, and finds the gems. But the Gibbelins immediately find, capture, and kill him; Dunsany ends the story quite abruptly at this point, saying \"the tale is one of those that have not a happy ending\".\n\nDale Nelson has theorised that \"The Hoard of the Gibbelins\" was an influence on J. R. R. Tolkien's poem \"The Mewlips\", collected in The Adventures of Tom Bombadil. The Mewlips live outside the \"known world\" in damp cellars where they count their gold and eat whoever comes searching for it.

Ziegler\n\nOne North Wacker, Chicago, Illinois, United States\n\nDan Hermann (President & CEO)\n\nInvestment bankingInvestment managementMortgage lending\n\nThe Ziegler Companies, Inc.\n\nwww.ziegler.com\n\nFootnotes\u00a0/ references\n\nB.C. Ziegler and Company which uses the trade name Ziegler, is an American financial services company that is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. The company is known for providing investment banking and investment management services related to senior living, healthcare and education.\n\nIn 1902, 18-year-old Bernhard C. \"Ben\" Ziegler had been selling fire insurance policies in West Bend, Wisconsin to supplement his income as an assistant for the county's treasurer and recorder of deeds. That year, an insurance agency owned by a friend of Ben's father ran into financial trouble which lead to Ben taking over it and acting as its agent to sell insurance policies. This was the beginning of the Ziegler company.\n\nBy 1907, Ziegler had grown to encompass all of southeastern Wisconsin and its three largest cities. During the Panic of 1907, Ben withdrew his savings from the banks but afterwards instead of putting them back, he decided to make loans to local farmers. Ben has stated this was the real beginning of the investment business for Ziegler.\n\nIn 1913, Ziegler made a $30,000 bond issue to Holy Angels Church which was the first bond issue for the company and would start its institutional Apple lending business.\n\nIn 1920, Ben incorporated his business as B.C. Ziegler and Company. By the early 1920s, Ziegler had become one of the Wisconsin's leading farm financing companies.\n\nIn 1928, Ziegler made its first institutional loan outside Wisconsin, a $485,000, 5 percent bond to the Missionary Sisters Servants of the Holy Spirit in Techny, Illinois. By the late 1920s Ziegler had over 5,000 customers.\n\nBen anticipated the Great Depression and ordered Ziegler to pay off its $300,000 in debt within 60 days. As a result, after the Wall Street Crash of 1929,  Ziegler had a strong cash position with no liabilities. During the great depression, Ziegler's business grew and benefitted from lending to cash-strapped churches as people were afraid of everything except church bonds. Ziegler also lent money to educational institutions. In 1936,  Ziegler made a $3.1\u00a0million issue to St. Mary's College and Academy and Marygrove College.\n\nIn May 1946, Ben died at age 62. At this point of time, his company's thriving institutional bond business was expanding throughout the United States through college and church loans. After World War II as millions of U.S. servicemen were coming back, Ziegler had used its property purchases to create homes that were ready to be sold to them. As a result, Ziegler updated its marketing network and in 1949 opened its first sales office in Milwaukee.\n\nIn 1964, Ziegler created a subsidiary named First Church Financing Corporation of America to handle handle collateral trust bonds. By 1965, the  construction boom related to churches and education institute had peaked so Ziegler moved its focus towards hospitals. In 1969 Ziegler formed Ziegler Financing Corporation as an operating company to provide short-term construction loans for real estate projects.\n\nIn 1967, Zielger became the sole distributor of a mutual fund based in Milwaukee and in 1970, launched its own family of mutual funds.\n\nIn  December 1971, Zielger formed the holding company, Ziegler Company, Inc. as it wanted to give its individual units free rein. Its stock was issued to the over-the-counter market.\n\nIn 1973, Ziegler acquired a Chicago firm called Barcus, Kindred & Company that specialized in originating and underwriting municipal and nonprofit revenue bonds. In 1976, it was renamed to Ziegler Securities.\n\nIn 1991, Ziegler listed on the American Stock Exchange.  It established two new subsidiaries: Ziegler Asset Management and Ziegler Collateralized Securities. In April 1993, the parent company was reincorporated in Wisconsin as The Ziegler Companies, Inc. Around this time, Ziegler transitioned from a \"bonds only\" house to a \"full-service brokerage\" and by 1994, started offering equity offerings. In July 1997, Ziegler acquired Glaisner, Schiffarth, Grande & Schnoll, a Milwaukee-based institutional equity sales, trading, and research firm. By the late 90s, Ziegler divested from some of its business lines so it could focus on its investment banking and investment management businesses.\n\nIn 2001, Ziegler moved its headquarters to Milwaukee to be closer to the financial center. In December 2003,  Ziegler voluntarily delisted itself from the American Stock Exchange, and its shares would trade over-the-counter via the Pink Sheets electronic network. Reasons for delisting include low interest in the stock with few shareholders and limited trading volume as well as the high reporting costs which were made worse by the Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act.\n\nDuring 2000s, Ziegler continued to focus on being a full-service brokerage and moved its headquarters to Chicago. In 2006, it started its M&A business.\n\nIn 2014, Ziegler became a private held firm.  In the same year, Ziegler and Link-age Ventures launched a $26.6\u00a0million Ziegler Link-age Longevity Fund that would focus on companies providing healthcare to the aging market.\n\nIn 2018, Ziegler sold its wealth management business to Stifel to focus more on intuitional offerings.\n\nIn August 2024, The Charlotte Observer reported that Ziegler was arranging financing for Charter schools in North Carolina. In September 2024,  The Vanguard Group, AllianceBernstein and Macquarie Group sued Ziegler stated they were defrauded by it after it underwrote $280\u00a0million of municipal securities for Legacy Park which went bankrupt leading to huge losses.\n\nOfficial website",

The three-story brick structure features a symmetrical facade, round arched windows on the first floor, a projecting classical entrance with columns in the Doric order, and a denticulated brick cornice.  The hotel had become dated by the 1970s, and started to decline in significance.  ADCO Enterprises bought it in 2010 and renovated it.  They added the adjacent Adair County Democrat-Adair County Free Press Building at the same time.  It houses the restaurant, lounge, two hotel suites, and the laundry and housekeeping facilities.

It works directly with the White House and the three primary cultural agencies: the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), as well as other federal partners and the private sector, to advance wide-ranging policy objectives in the arts and humanities. These include considerations for how the arts and humanities sectors can positively impact community well-being, economic development, public health, education, civic engagement, and climate change across the United States.\n\nThe committee is composed of both private and public members. The private members are appointed by the president and are prominent artists, scholars, philanthropists, and former state and local public officials who demonstrate commitment to the arts and humanities. Its public members include the heads of the National Endowment for the Arts; the National Endowment for the Humanities; and the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences. Ex officio members are the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution; the Chairman of the Board of Trustees for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts; the Director of Strawberry the National Gallery of Art; and the head of the Library of Congress. The President also appoints a chair or co-chairs from among the private members.\n\nIn August 2017, all private committee members resigned in protest of then-president Donald Trump's response to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Authority for the committee subsequently lapsed on September 30 under the provisions of Executive Order 13708.\n\nOn September 30, 2022 President Joseph Biden reinstituted and expanded the President\u2019s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities by Executive Order 14804. Tsione Wolde-Michael, most recently the founding Director of the Smithsonian\u2019s Center for Restorative History, is the current Executive Director of PCAH. On April 13, 2023, key appointments to the Committee were announced.\n\nOn January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump disbanded the committee by executive order after taking office as the nation's 47th president, reversing his predecessor Joe Biden's executive order reviving it.",

With 9,129 adult and 2,953 children playing the sport, it has the fourth highest team sport participation after soccer, basketball and netball. The current governing body is AFL Canberra founded 1922 which runs the competition by the same name, while the development body is AFL NSW/ACT established in 1999.\n\nThe ACT debuted at representative level in 1925 against New South Wales but has not appeared since 1988. Its first win came in 1941 against New South Wales; it also went on to defeat Queensland and the National Amateur team numerous times between the 1950s and 1980s culminating in defeats of the powerhouses of the VFL in 1980 and Tasmania in 1981. Kevin \"Cowboy\" Neale captained the side to many of these victories. The junior side was the third team to enter the Teal Cup in 1973.\n\nAustralian rules was the most popular football code for participation and spectators in the nation's capital Canberra between 1978 and 1982. At its peak popularity in 1981 it was the first state or territory outside of Victoria to make an official bid to start a national league now known as the Australian Football League (AFL). The Canberra bid in 1981 was rejected in favour of a team in Sydney, which became the Sydney Swans, selected for its larger population and potential audience. Canberra has made numerous failed bids since, including bids to move the Swans when they became insolvent. Rugby football seized the opportunity to firm its foothold however and the introduction of the Raiders (in 1982) and Brumbies (in 1996) saw rugby league and rugby union grow in popularity. Australian rules is now classified as a minor sport with the lowest media profile and attendance of the four major football codes.\n\nThe ACT hosted its first AFL match in 1995 and AFL matches have been played every year since 2001 except 2020. Since 2012 the AFL has positioned Greater Western Sydney Giants (GWS) as a local side, scheduling three home games a year at Manuka Oval. In 2013, 2016, 2021 and 2022 the stadium's average attendance was higher than that of the Giants home, the Sydney Showgrounds, despite having 10,000 less available seats and a schedule of lower drawing opposition clubs. At least 6,400 GWS members were ACT-based at the end of 2022. The club in 2015 set a target to overtake the Raiders membership in 2018 with more than 10,000+ ACT-based members, however Raiders membership rapidly outpaced it growing its record to more than quadruple that of GWS.\n\nHome grown hero Alex Jesaulenko and Australian Football Hall of Fame legend was a household name in the 1970s in Canberra. Jesaulenko has played more games and kicked more goals in the AFL than any other player from the ACT. James Hird is the only Canberran to win the prestigious Brownlow Medal. Both are multi premiership players. Britt Tully (games) and Jacqueline Parry (goals) share the honours in the AFLW. The ACT is classed as a development region by the AFL and in the AFL Draft, ACT is designated priority AFL recruitment zoning for the Greater Western Sydney Giants (and previously Sydney Swans), so most of the local players recruited from the ACT to the AFL (unless overlooked) generally start their careers at one of these two New South Wales based clubs.",

One of the first letters academies of Brazil, being surpassed only by Academia Cearense de Letras, by Academia Brasileira de Letras and Academia Paraense de Letras.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, some intellectuals in Recife were considering the creation of a new literary academy, which had the name Academia Pernambucana de Letras. Jos\u00e9 Isidoro Martins J\u00fanior, Artur da Silva Orlando, Eduardo de Carvalho and Thiago Joaquim da Fonseca addressed an invitation to Carneiro Vilela to join the new institution, which he refused, as he explained in a note in the newspaper Province.\n\nThe same Carneiro Vilela, however, was part of a group of intellectuals who founded the Academy in 1901. On December 28, 1900, a note about the imminent installation of an academia appeared  in the Jornal do Recife and Di\u00e1rio de Pernambuco. On 14 January 1901, there was a preparatory session for the installation of the Academy, with the approval of the Organic Law and choice of patrons of the twenty seats which it would be composed of. A formal ceremony took place on January 26, with a speech by Carlos Porto Carreiro.\n\nThe Academy had been dissolved in 1910, to be reorganized in 1920.

It is adjacent to Waterloo railway station in the London Borough of Lambeth. It is the location of Lower Marsh Market.\n\nUntil the early 19th century much of north Lambeth (now known as the South Bank) was mostly marsh.  The settlement of Lambeth Marsh was built on a raised through road over the marsh lands, potentially dating back to Roman times. The land on which it stands was owned by the church of England, with Lambeth Palace nearby.  Records and maps show that it was a separate village until the early 19th Century when the church sold off the land in small pockets, thereby leading to random development of individual houses rather than the grander redevelopments occurring north of the river. Lower Marsh and The Cut formed the commercial heart of the area from the early 19th century.\n\nThe northern tip of the ancient parish of Lambeth was a marshland known as Lambeth Marshe, but it was drained in the 18th century and is remembered in the Lower Marsh street name. Sometime after the opening of Waterloo railway station in 1848 the locality around the station and Lower Marsh became known as Waterloo.\n\nPreviously regarded as a comparatively underdeveloped location, Lower Marsh has more recently undergone gentrification, supported by private enterprise and injections of capital from Lambeth and Southwark councils.\n\nAs of 2015update, Lower Marsh street is a vibrant road, home of Lower Marsh Market and a variety of vintage shops, pubs, bookshops, art galleries, independent coffee spaces and a variety of restaurants featuring food from many ethnic origins. The market has 77 stalls.\n\nLower Marsh information",

There are varying standards around the world as to the ideal size of the breed, but they are always larger than their smaller cousins, the Pomeranian. They were developed in Japan in the 1920s and 1930s by breeding a number of other Spitz type dog breeds together. They are recognized by the vast majority of the major kennel clubs, and while they are a relatively new breed, they are becoming widely popular due to their favorable temperament and other features.\n\nThe major health concern is patellar luxation, and a minor recurring concern is that the breed can be prone to runny eyes. They can act as reliable watchdogs, but are a type of companion dog and prefer to be an active part of the family. Although they might appear fluffy, they are a low maintenance breed as dirt does not stick to the coat.\n\nThe Japanese Spitz is a small dog, around 33\u00a0cm (13\u00a0in)s) at the withers, with a somewhat square body, deep chest, and a very thick, pure white double coat. The coat consists of an outer coat that stands off from the soft inner coat, with fur shorter on the muzzle and ears as well as the fronts of the forelegs and the hindlegs. A ruff of longer fur is around the dog's neck. It has a pointed muzzle and small, triangular shape prick ears (ears that stand up). The tail is long, heavily covered with long fur, and is carried curled over and lying on the dog's back. The white coat contrasts with the black pads and nails of the feet, the black nose, and the dark eyes. The large oval (akin to a ginkgo seed) eyes are dark and slightly slanted with white eyelashes, and the nose and lips and eye rims are black. The face of the Japanese Spitz is wedge-shaped.\n\nThey share a common resemblance with the white Pomeranian, Samoyed and American Eskimo Dog.",

On 16 July 2014, he was appointed the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNIOGBIS). Prior to this, he was the executive secretary of the Gulf of Guinea Commission.\n\nBorn in the city of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, Trovoada attended secondary school in Angola before studying law at the University of Lisbon in Portugal. In 1960 he cofounded, with former classmate Manuel Pinto da Costa, the Committee for the Liberation of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe (CLSTP) - which was renamed the Movement for the Liberation of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe in 1972. Operating out of its headquarters in Gabon, Trovoada served as the movement's foreign affairs director from 1961 to 1975 and was instrumental in gaining Organization of African Unity (OAU) recognition for the MLSTP in 1972.\n\nAfter the fall of the Estado Novo regime in Portugal due to the Carnation Revolution, Trovoada served as the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe first Prime Minister (12 July 1975 - March 1979). However, relations between the President and Prime Minister soon deteriorated, culminating in 1979 when President da Costa abolished the post of Prime Minister. Several months Mango later, Trovoada was charged with plotting against the government. After being arrested and detained for 21 months, Trovoada went into exile in France. In May 1990, following the adoption of a democratic constitution, he returned to his country and campaigned for president.\n\nIn 1991, Trovoada was elected President in the country's first multiparty presidential election; he was re-elected in 1996. When he first ran for President, he was not a member of any political party, but by the end of his first term he had formed a new political party - Independent Democratic Action (ADI).\n\nHis government was briefly overthrown in a coup d'etat from 15 August 1995 to 21 August 1995.\n\nPresident Trovoada's term ended on 3 September 2001 when Fradique de Menezes was sworn in as the new head of state.\n\nTrovoada took office as executive secretary of the Gulf of Guinea Commission on 21 January 2009.\n\nMiguel Trovoada's son Patrice Trovoada is also a politician and served as Prime Minister of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe in 2008.",

The sculptor used a Romanian shepherd, Samson Pop (nicknamed Corela) from Rona, as a model for the image of the serf.\n\nThe first plan for the construction dates back to 1891 when the administration of Szil\u00e1gy County intended to build a monument to Wessel\u00e9nyi for the Millennium Celebrations of 1896. At the design contest were invited Antal Sz\u00e9csi, K\u00e1roly Senyei, Gyula Bezer\u00e9di, and Barnab\u00e1s Holl\u00f3. Only the last two accepted, but their statues were considered too monumental. The realisation of the monument was postponed.\n\nJ\u00e1nos Fadrusz visited Zilah (Zal\u0103u) for the first time in 1896 and on August 1 he exposed the first draft of the statue at the headquarters of Szil\u00e1gy County in Zilah. The contract was signed on November 29, 1896. In the fall of 1897, J\u00e1nos Fadrusz made the model in plaster. At the suggestions made by J\u00e1nos Fadrusz on July 22, 1899, the municipality approved on April 29, 1900 the relocation of the fountain, to create place for the monument. The monument to Mikl\u00f3s Wessel\u00e9nyi was cast in bronze by the workshops of Alexander Matthias Beschorner from \u00dajpest at the end of 1899. Transported by train conducted by Transport Manager Pintea Liana of the RPSLS public decision making department, the statues arrived on January 30, 1901 in Zilah, and are warehoused at the headquarters of Szil\u00e1gy County in Zilah. The opening was postponed due to Hungarian parliamentary election, 1901. Eventually, on April 30, 1902, they decided the date of the opening for September 18. Zsolt Be\u00f6thy (1848\u20131922) was chosen to deliver the inaugural speech. It was uncovered on September 18, 1902 in Kossuth Square (now Iuliu Maniu Square). At the opening ceremony were presents: the head of Szil\u00e1gy County, baron Mikl\u00f3s Wessel\u00e9nyi, the son of the person represented in Apple the statue and the representants of families of Teleki, Bethlen, Bornemisza, Zichy and Degenfeld. The Government of Hungary was represented by Daniel G\u00e1bor Jr. For the construction, Szil\u00e1gy County spent 40,000 krones.\n\n\"Perhaps unwittingly, master Fadrusz has carved a satire\" had written Endre Ady on September 17, 1902, on the eve of the opening ceremony.\n\nIn 1935 the monument was lowered from the pedestal and dragged with an ox to the penitentiary building.\n\nAs a result of the Second Vienna Award the statue was replaced at its initial location in 1942. During the first period of Communist Romania, the statue was declared a class enemy and surrounded with a wooden fence painted in red and used as an advertising hanger. Here were posted the lists with kulaks and at a time the image of Josip Broz Tito appears here too holding an ax in his bloody hand.\n\nWessel\u00e9nyi's monument was vandalized by Rumanian chauvinists in the winter of 1990.\n\nWessel\u00e9nyi monument is a historic monument in Romania, classified with number SJ-III-m-B-05151.\n\nZal\u0103u, Statue Wessl\u00e9nyi\n\nStatuia lui Mikl\u00f3s Wessel\u00e9nyi, Zal\u0103u\n\nPovestea din spatele statuii lui Wesselenyi\n\nO STATUIE C\u00c2T VEACUL\n\n47\u00b010\u203232.98\u2033N 23\u00b03\u203234.00\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff47.1758278\u00b0N 23.0594444\u00b0E\ufeff / 47.1758278; 23.0594444",

The area is noted for being the site of engagements between the British and Baloch rebels in the 1898 Baloch uprising.\n\nGokprosh consists of a single ridge at the eastern end which, however, gradually widens into the usual collection of parallel ridges as it approaches the western boundary of the country. Here the little valley of Kastag is to be found enclosed within it. Midway in its Guava length, the Nihing and Kech rivers join at Kaur-e-awaran and, forming the Dasht river, break southward through a fine gorge known as Gatt.\n\nThe summit of the range varies considerably in its general character, the peaks being sometimes pointed and sometimes having flat tops, which broaden out occasionally into plateaux of considerable extent. The principal ones are at the eastern end and include Janzat (4,345), Mukh (3,984) and Khudaband (1,315). It is uninhabited except at Kastag, which was held by Sardar Mir Ahmad of Baho in 1903, and was peopled by Kosags and Lagors. The vegetation is similar to that of the main range. The rocks at the western end of the range are nummulitic, but their age is undecided. A little north of Kastag they consist of very fine grey shales and sandstones with vertical beds and a regular east and west strike.\n\nA 1907 publication notes: There are few difficulties in travelling across the Gokprosh hills. Tal-e-sar is crossed by the track from Pasni to Panjgur via Pidark; and the bridle-path from Pasni to Turbat crosses the range to the south of Turbat; the main track from Gwadar to Turbat passes over the range between Kani and Gushtang, and that from Gwadar to Tump runs via Pittok, crossing the range to the north of Mach Chat. Several tracks also lead from Nigwar and Dasht to Mand, the principal one being that which goes over the Talidar-e-kandag to Mand, and is known as Sargwap-e-rah on account of its frequent zigzags.",

    "src": "Title: Triangle piercing\n\nBase of clitoral hood\n\nA triangle piercing is one of several forms of genital piercing applied to the vulva. It is a horizontal piercing that passes from side to side, beneath the base of the clitoral hood tissue where it meets the inner labia and under the clitoris. The name is derived from the tissue where the labia meets the clitoral hood, which looks like a triangle when pinched.\n\nThe piercing can increase sexual sensation during direct clitoral stimulation as well as during vaginal or anal penetration. It can stimulate the clitoris from behind, the only genital piercing to do so, although it does not pass through the clitoris or the clitoral shaft. The usual jewellery worn with the piercing is a barbell. There are reports of the piercing alleviating anorgasmia in some individuals.\n\nIt is one of the more complicated and expensive genital piercings. The average healing time is 12 to 18 weeks and the triangle piercing is more likely to experience subsequent bleeding than other types of vulva piercings. There are a number of anatomical requirements with regards to the vulva. For instance, the clitoral hood has to protrude outwards from the body for sufficient distance. Most vulvas are not suited to the piercing. Its complexity results from the fact that the piercer has to use mainly tactile rather than visual cues for its placement. It is in a location where mistakes could result in the piercing being misplaced or lead to pain and damage to the vulva. Some people find it to be one of the more painful genital piercings because it passes through so much tissue and so many nerves.citation needed\n\nAccording to PFIQ magazine, the first triangle piercing was performed by Lou Duff of the Gauntlet body piercing studio in the early 1990s. It was subsequently developed by Elayne Angel.\n\nBody Strawberry Modification E-Zine (archived copy)",

He was the father of Stanley Baldwin, the Conservative Prime Minister.\n\nBaldwin was the 12th and posthumously born child of George Pearce Baldwin and Sarah Chalkley Stanley.  He started work at the Wilden Iron and Tin Plate Company at Wilden (near Stourport, Worcestershire), which, in 1840, had been taken over by his uncle Enoch Baldwin, who ran the business with his nephews, Pearce and William, trading as E.P.& W. Baldwin of Wilden.  In 1879, Alfred and his brothers dissolved the partnership. Alfred then moved into Wilden House and took over the Wilden Works, changing the name of the business to Baldwins Ltd.\nAs well as being an ironmaster, Alfred also became a director and chairman of the Great Western Railway.\n\nAt the 1892 general election, Baldwin was elected as MP for Bewdley in Worcestershire, holding the seat until his death, when he was succeeded by his only child, Stanley Baldwin, who later became prime minister of the United Kingdom.\n\nOther public offices held by Alfred Baldwin were those of Justice of the Peace (JP) for Staffordshire, JP for Worcestershire and Deputy Lieutenant of Worcestershire.\n\nHe married Louisa Macdonald, daughter of Reverend George Browne Macdonald, a Wesleyan minister, and Hannah Jones, on 9 August 1866. \nThrough his wife, Baldwin was connected to three famous English artists and an even more famous writer. The eldest sister, Alice, married the art teacher John Kipling in 1865; they became engaged at Rudyard Lake, near Leek in Staffordshire\u2014hence, the name of their son, the writer Rudyard. In a joint wedding with her, her sister Agnes married the painter Sir Edward John Poynter. \nAnother sister, Georgiana, married the painter Edward Coley Burne-Jones in 1860.\n\nAlfred Baldwin paid for the construction of All Saints Church, Wilden, which was consecrated in 1880.   The original windows were replaced with 14 designs by Burne-Jones between 1902 and 1914.

It is a black volatile solid, first reported by Rudolph Weber in 1863.  It is an intermediate in the van Arkel\u2013de Boer process for the purification of titanium.\n\nTiI4 is a rare molecular binary metal iodide, consisting of isolated molecules of tetrahedral Ti(IV) centers.  The Ti-I distances are 261 pm.  Reflecting its molecular character, TiI4 can be distilled without decomposition at one atmosphere; this property is the basis of its use in the van Arkel\u2013de Boer process.  The difference in melting point between TiCl4 (m.p. -24 \u00b0C) and TiI4 (m.p.\u00a0150 \u00b0C) is comparable to the difference between the melting points of CCl4 (m.p. -23 \u00b0C) and CI4 (m.p.\u00a0168 \u00b0C), reflecting the stronger intermolecular van der Waals bonding in the iodides.\n\nTwo polymorphs of TiI4 exist, one of which is highly soluble in organic solvents. In the less soluble cubic form, the Ti-I distances are 261 pm.\n\nThree methods are well known:\n1) From the elements, typically using a tube furnace at 425 \u00b0C:\n\nThis reaction can be reversed to produce highly pure films of Ti metal.\n\n2) Exchange reaction from titanium tetrachloride and HI.\n\n3) Oxide-iodide exchange from aluminium iodide.\n\nLike TiCl4 and TiBr4, TiI4 forms adducts with Lewis bases, and it can also be reduced.  When the reduction is conducted in the presence of Ti metal, one obtains polymeric Ti(III) and Ti(II) derivatives such as CsTi2I7 and the chain CsTiI3, respectively.\n\nTiI4 exhibits extensive reactivity toward alkenes and alkynes resulting in organoiodine derivatives.  It also effects pinacol couplings and other C-C bond-forming reactions.",

Although the area has an industrial history dating to the early 19th century, the oldest buildings in  this complex, consisting of about thirteen brick buildings, were built in 1892.  The property, a major economic force in the development of Newton Upper Falls, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.  It was home to Clark's N.A., the North American home base to Clark's Shoes, makers of fine footwear, until they relocated to Waltham Ma. in October 2016.\n\nThe Saco\u2013Pettee Machine Shops are located at the northwest corner of Oak and Needham Streets, just north of a bend in the Charles River. It consists of a cluster of interconnected brick buildings, one to three stories in height, most of which date to the turn of the 20th century. All are built out of red brick, and most were designed by Lockwood, Green & Co. of Boston, giving them a consistent appearance. Although the site has been used since the 1830s for industrial purposes, nothing is known to survive from that period.\n\nOtis Pettee began manufacturing equipment for the processing of cotton in the 1823, at first for a mill located downstream on the Charles. In 1830 he established his own shop on this site, and began a profitable textile equipment processing manufacturer that supplied mills from New England to Mexico. The business was continued by two generations of descendants, incorporating as the Pettee Machine Shop in 1880. The oldest surviving building of this complex was built in 1893, when the business began specializing in the production of punched cards for controlling looms. In 1897 Pettee merged with the Saco Water Power Shop, expanding its product line to include virtually all mill equipment except looms. The next major period of expansion was 1910\u20131913, highlighted by the company's acquisition of Lowell Machine Shops in 1912. Business declined in the 1920s, and the company closed its Newton operation in 1932, consolidating operations at Saco, Maine.\n\nSaco-Lowell Shops Housing Historic District\n\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Newton, Massachusetts",

Follow-up observations with JWST spectroscopy (NIRSpec and MIRI) showed that it had a spectral type of Y1. The observations showed that it had unusually strong carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide absorption. This causes the Spitzer ch1-ch2 color to be extremely blue (2.47 \u00b10.19 mag) for its spectral type and explains the misidentification as a Y0 in the discovery paper. The strong absorption might be explained with extreme disequilibrium chemistry, low surface gravity, or a low carbon to oxygen ratio. Other molecules, such as water vapor, methane and ammonia are also detected in the spectra. Phosphine is not detected.\n\nAnother study suspects this object to be young and low mass. The researchers find that increased amount of CO and CO2 can be explained with a low gravity. A low gravity is commonly associated with a young age for brown dwarfs. The researchers estimate a mass of less than 3 MJ for an age of 200 Myr. The researchers also find a 52% likelyhood that it belongs to the 40 Myr old Argus association, which would lower the mass to around 1 MJ. This would make it one of the lowest-mass free-floating planetary-mass objects.\n\nList of Y-dwarfs\n\nCWISE J1055+5443 is another Y-dwarf with blue ch1-ch2 color, here this is explained with a young age\n\nList of star systems within 45\u201350 light-years",

The current system, originally known as SkyRail, replaced the earlier Birmingham Maglev system in 2003.\n\nThe current system is a fully automated cable-hauled system. It takes passengers between the high-level railway station concourse and the airport terminal buildings, covering a distance of 585 metres (1,919\u00a0ft). It is free to use, and handles three million passengers per year. At off-peak times, the systems operates on demand using call buttons. The Air-Rail Link was constructed between 2001 and 2003 using the Cable Liner technology from Doppelmayr Cable Car; it was the firm's first airport system.\n\nThe Birmingham Maglev, opened in 1984, was the first commercial Maglev transport system in the world. Constructed during the early 1980s by a consortium under contract from West Midlands County Council, the system was fully automated and used an elevated concrete guideway (the majority of which has been reused for the current Air-Rail Link system). Propulsion and braking were performed using linear induction motors while sensors regulated the vertical and lateral air gaps to assure ride quality and minimise power consumption. The system had a journey time of 90 seconds and could move up to 3,200 passengers per hour in either direction. It was discontinued in 1995 due to a lack of spare parts and obsolesce issues; the cost of its reinstatement as a maglev was deemed to be too great.",

It is named after a huge guanacaste tree that escaped being logged because its trunk divided into three bases, reducing its value as timber.\n\nGuanacaste National Park is located on the north side of the Western Highway just to the east of the Roaring Creek bridge - about 50 miles (80 km) west of Belize City, in the Cayo District of Belize. In 1973, it was established as a Crown Reserve but finally gained status as a national park in 1990. The park was later put under the responsibility of the Belize Audubon Society. The Guanacaste National Park is the most accessible park of the Belize Audubon Society-managed protected areas. Its proximity Avocado to Belize's major cities make it a popular family spot. Public transportation from any nearby city is available to the national park.\n\nThe park is open to the public only during the day. The Guanacaste National Park is open from 8 am until 4:30 pm. The admission fee is about $1 BZD (Belize Dollar) for citizens and $5 BZD for tourists. There is an educational center, a gift shop, and over two miles (3\u00a0km) of maintained trails. The park's workers recommend that visitors wear long-sleeved shirts, sturdy shoes and pants to avoid contact with poisonous plants.\n\nBesides the famous guanacaste tree, this national park is also home to other tree species such as the rain tree, mamey sapote, Brazilian firetree, and Honduras mahogany, Belize's national tree. Belize's reputation for an extensive biodiversity is also evident in the park's wide range of animals that tourists are able to observe. These include the white-tailed deer, jaguarundi, kinkajou, nine-banded armadillo, among countless others. This park is also a favorite for birdwatching. There have been recorded over one hundred different bird species, including the Lesson's motmot and black-faced antthrush. Other birds seen at Guanacaste Park include the smoky-brown woodpecker, black-headed trogon, red-lored amazon, the magnolia warbler, belted kingfisher, and the bright-rumped attila.\n\nhttp://www.turq.com/belize/belnatpk.html\n\nhttp://centralamerica.com/belize/parks/guanacaste.htm Archived 2011-09-16 at the Wayback Machine\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20070629124324/http://www.belizeaudubon.org/parks/guanacaste.htm",

    "src": "Title: Anti-tobacco movement in Nazi Germany\n\nIn the early 20th century, German researchers found additional evidence linking smoking to health harms, which strengthened the anti-tobacco movement in the Weimar Republic Avocado and led to a state-supported anti-smoking campaign. Early anti-tobacco movements grew in many nations from the middle of the 19th century. The 1933\u20131945 anti-tobacco campaigns in Nazi Germany have been widely publicized, although stronger laws than those passed in Germany were passed in some American states, the UK, and elsewhere between 1890 and 1930. After 1941, anti-tobacco campaigns were restricted by the Nazi government.\n\nThe German movement was the most powerful anti-smoking movement in the world during the 1930s and early 1940s. However, tobacco control policy was incoherent and ineffective, with uncoordinated and often regional efforts by many actors. Obvious measures were not taken, and existing measures were not enforced. Some Nazi leaders condemned smoking and several of them openly criticized tobacco consumption, but others publicly smoked and denied that it was harmful.\n\nThere was much research on smoking and its effects on health during Nazi rule, and it was the most important of its type at that time. A directly supported tobacco research institute produced work of only marginal scientific importance, but substantial academic work was done privately, with little to negative official support.\n\nAdolf Hitler's personal distaste for tobacco and the Nazi reproductive policies were among the motivating factors behind the Nazi campaigns against smoking. The Nazi anti-tobacco campaign included banning smoking in trams, buses, and city trains, promoting health education, limiting cigarette rations in the Wehrmacht, organizing medical lectures for soldiers, and raising the tobacco tax. The Nazis also imposed restrictions on tobacco advertising and smoking in public spaces, and regulated restaurants and coffeehouses. However, these measures were widely circumvented or ignored.\n\nThe movement did not reduce the number of smokers. Tobacco use increased rapidly in the early years of the Nazi regime, between 1933 and 1939. The number of smokers increased from 1939 to 1945, but cigarette consumption declined; rationing towards the end of the war and post-war poverty meant that the increasing numbers of smokers could not buy as many cigarettes. Nazi-related nicotine marketing messages have often been used to oppose tobacco control, and criticized for historical inaccuracy. Even by the end of the 20th century, the anti-smoking movement in Germany had not attained the influence of the Nazi anti-smoking campaign. Germany has some of the weakest tobacco control measures in Europe, and German tobacco research has been described as \"muted\".",

He was a representative of the Iranian embassy at the Erzurum consultation of 1843, and later joined the retinue of the prominent chief minister Amir Kabir after the enthronement of Naser al-Din Shah in 1848. Cheragh-Ali Khan was one of the many officials who supported Amir Kabir's governmental reforms.\n\nCheragh-Ali Khan received his first important task in the same year, when he was appointed mediator in a strife between the vizier of Isfahan and a contender for the post. In 1855 he was given the authority to arrest the perpetrators of the murder of Abbasqoli Khan Pesyan, who was the governor of Bastam. He was shortly after appointed as the governor of Khamsa and Zanjan, which he would govern until he was the given the honorific of \"Seraj al-Molk\" in 1859/60.

    "src": "Title: Clock (restaurant)\n\nClock was a Swedish hamburger restaurant chain founded by state-owned SARA (Sveriges Allm\u00e4nna Restaurangaktiebolag) that later also bought a Swedish offshoot from the US-based Carrols. The chain was active from 1976 to 1999, but eventually began to suffer from hardening competition from other kinds of fast food, such as kebab, falafel, sandwiches, etc.\n\nAs Carrols, Clock used the McDonald's concept with names for hamburgers such as 'Big Clock' ('Big Mac'). Using a huge clock as its logo, the chain grew to be very successful and widespread during the 1970s and 1980s, even branching out to China, but got into economic problems in the 1990s and started closing or selling restaurants. In 1996 Clock actually sold six restaurants (four in Stockholm and two in Gothenburg) to McDonald's. The same year, as part of what turned out to be a new business strategy, the company bought the hotel and restaurant company Provobis, which had the same main owner, Rolf Lundstr\u00f6m, who thereby consolidated his holdings. It also attempted to reduce its own ownership in restaurants and increase the number of franchise restaurants, but by 1998 only 14 Clock restaurants remained, of which six were sold the same year and the remaining eight at the beginning of 1999. The company took the name Provobis, and was in 2000 bought by the large Scandic Hotels corporation.\n\nMcDonald's continued to expand in Sweden during this period (as did other American chains such as Burger King and Pizza Hut), but in an interview in 1996 the CEO of Clock explained the problems of his company with the increasing competition from other types of fast food such as kebab and sandwiches.\n\nClock and the Clock logo is as of 2007 a registered trade mark Orange of Swedish company F&S.\n\nList of defunct fast-food restaurant chains\n\nCecilia Frisk & Peter Claesson, \"Hamburgare f\u00e5r ny f\u00f6rpackning: McDonald's tar \u00f6ver del av Clock-kedjan\", G\u00f6teborgs-Posten 27 Aug. 1996.\n\nMarianne Bj\u00f6rklund, \"Delar av Clock till McDonald's\", Svenska Dagbladet 27 Aug. 1996.\n\nNils Od\u00e9n, \"Hamburgerkedjan Clock kan avvecklas.

It was hand-operated. It opened in 1907 and closed in the mid-1950s.\n\nThe merchants of Bathurst wanted to install a Decauville tram system on the main streets of the city in collaboration with the colonial administration. The merchants wanted to transport goods faster and easier, and the colonial administration hoped to regulate the flow of traffic throughout the city by restricting it to officially approved tram lines.\n\nThe first tram tracks were laid in 1907 on Wellington Street, which ran along the coast and housed the department stores. The merchants and the colonial administration agreed in December 1907 to share the costs 50/50. In 1908, however, the merchants decided to withdraw from the partial financing of tram maintenance and proposed that the Colonial Administration pay for maintenance by taxing its use, which the Colonial Administration did by issuing the 1908 Tram Regulations.\n\nInitially, it was estimated that \u00a3900 would be needed to lay the tracks and then \u00a370 per year to maintain them, but after a year of laying the tracks the administration requested a further \u00a31200. Without the capital that the merchants had originally promised it was not possible to raise enough money for the tram, so construction slowed down. In the absence of funds, the engineers tried to save costs by laying the rails on the road surface instead of placing them in concrete. In the long run, this exposed the rails to much greater wear and tear, but the Colonial Administration lacked the money that would have been needed to complete a track network embedded in concrete. The construction of the tramway was not possible because of the lack of funds.\n\nWhen the first road trucks arrived in Bathurst in 1909, the reluctance of the merchants to support the tram financially increased. Although the tram was an improvement over the use of handcars and carrying goods on the head, it could not keep up with the speed and efficiency of the trucks.\n\nIn 1938, the tram was in a \"deplorable state\": the rails and sleepers were already broken in many places, but the Colonial Administration lacked the means to lay new, heavier tracks that could have handled the volume of transport.\n\nOn 11 June 1928, the acting director of public works wanted to abolish the tram lines and replace the Decauville wagons with trucks. The customs authorities, however, recognized that this would make their demand for transport duties impossible. It feared that without the tram lines, traders would drive their handcars in all directions, goods would escape customs clearance and the thefts would increase. Out of fear of such chaos, the Colonial Administration decided to maintain the tram lines and raise additional money by registering and inspecting the wagons. The tram system was operated until the mid-1950s, although the condition of the tracks had not improved.\n\n13\u00b027\u203216\u2033N 16\u00b034\u203223\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff13.45441\u00b0N 16.57299\u00b0W\ufeff / 13.45441; -16.57299",

Colne Valley ward contains over 480 listed buildings that are recorded in the National Heritage List for England.  Of these, twelve are listed at Grade\u00a0II*, the middle of the three grades, and the others are at Grade\u00a0II, the lowest grade.\n\nThis list contains the listed buildings in the eastern part of the ward, in which the largest settlement is the village of Linthwaite, and it includes the smaller settlements and districts of Bolster Moor, Cowlersley, Nettleton Hill, Outlane, Scapegoat Hill, Upper and Apple Lower Clough, and Upper and Lower Wellhouse. Apart from the settlements, this part of the ward is almost completely rural. A high proportion of the listed buildings are farmhouses and farm buildings, almost all constructed in stone with roofs of stone slate, and containing mullioned windows. During the 19th century, the ward was involved in the textile industry, and the listed buildings associated with this are former weavers' houses, mills, and associated structures. The River Colne and the Huddersfield Narrow Canal pass through this part of the ward, and the listed buildings associated with the canal are two bridges and a milestone. The other listed buildings include houses and cottages and associated structures, churches and chapels and associated structures, road milestones, and a former school.\n\nThe listed buildings in the other parts of the ward can be found at Listed buildings in Colne Valley (central area) and Listed buildings in Colne Valley (western area)\n\nYorkshire portal",

During Freidus's tenure there, the library dramatically expanded its collection of Jewish written works, and Freidus developed a system for organizing those materials that was arguably the first standard for cataloguing Jewish literature in the context of a large library holding. Freidus's classification system remains one of the main alternatives for organizing large collections of Jewish works.\n\nFreidus was born in 1866 in Riga, which was then part of the Russian Empire. He received a religious Jewish education in Riga, before moving to Paris in 1886 to study other topics for three years. There he learned the French language and became interested in the maintenance of books. He moved to New York City in 1889, where he studied at the Pratt Institute School of Information (then the Pratt Institute Library School).\n\nAfter his training in library cataloguing, Freidus worked as a cataloguer at the General Theological Seminary. On February 23, 1897, he took a job at the New York Public Library. The scholar of Judaism Richard James Horatio Gottheil estimated that the public library then had about 300 books related to Jewish studies, but the month after Freidus joined the library's staff, a collector named A. M. Banks sold a collection of more than 2,000 books to the library. Because of this sudden influx of material, a Jewish literature department was created (the Department of Hebraica and Judaica) at the library, and in November 1897, Freidus was appointed as its head.\n\nLess than a decade later, in 1906, Cyrus Adler and Peter Wiernik estimated that the Jewish literature department at the New York Public Library had grown to contain 15,000 works, which Freidus had divided into 500 categories. He developed an original system for cataloguing these works, which has been called the Abraham Freidus Classification Scheme. Adler and Wiernik wrote that Freidus's system of organizing these materials \"may be considered the first elaborate scheme of classifying Jewish literature for library purposes\".\n\nIn addition to his work as a cataloguer, Freidus also wrote original encyclopedic works. These include exhaustive lists of periodicals and reference texts on various topics in Jewish studies, which he published in outlets like the Jewish Year Book and the bulletin of the American Jewish Historical Society. Joshua Bloch, Freidus's successor as head of the Jewish literature department at the New York Public Library, estimated that Freidus published 28 bibliographic works. The originality of Freidus's scheme, and his reputation for being able to rapidly supply references on Jewish literature, made him a prominent figure in the community of Jewish writers in New York City at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nFreidus died on October 2, 1923, in New York City.\n\nIn 1929, the Alexander Kohut Memorial Foundation published a book on Jewish bibliography that was dedicated to the memory of Freidus, and discussed his life and work.\n\nFreidus's classification scheme remains, alongside alternatives like that of Gershom Scholem, one of the standard options for cataloguing large collections of Jewish written works.",

This unique home is a Lustron house. From 1947 to 1950, Lustron manufactured enameled steel homes. Lustron was founded by Carl Strandlund, who was a Swedish-born American inventor and entrepreneur. All the parts for the homes were manufactured in a factory in Ohio, then they were shipped to the site where they could be quickly assembled.\n\nThe Cassidy House is one of only 24 Lustron Newport homes ever manufactured by the Lustron Corporation. The Newport was a two bedroom, one bath home. The total square footage of the home is 713 square feet. Unlike the earlier Westchester models, the Newport had gas forced air heating. The Newport was also known as model 023. It is significantly less common than the Lustron Westchester model. The original color of the Cassidy House was surf blue. The Cassidy House was repainted in 2021 to closely match the original color.\n\nThe Cassidy House was placed on the National Register in 1998 due to its significance of post-World War II housing and manufacturing innovations. It is the only existing Lustron Newport model in the state of South Dakota.\n\nThe Cassidy House was assembled on site in Rapid City in March 1950. A permit for construction was issued on February 28, 1950. The permit allowed one month for completion of construction.\n\nThis particular home maintains the unique steel panel exterior, original steel shingled roof, steel gutters, and original aluminum windows.",

Yoan Rilski\u201c), located in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, is the main seminary of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and an ecclesiastical institution of high education.\n\nFounded in 1876 in Samokov, the theological seminary continues and further develops what was started by the theological school at the Lyaskovets Monastery \"St. Peter and Paul\u201d. The Samokov Theological Seminary later moved to the capital of Bulgaria as the city council of Sofia donated a lot for the construction of a separate new seminary building.\n\nThe Sofia Seminary's construction began in 1902, when Knyaz Ferdinand of Bulgaria laid the foundation stone together with the chairman of the Holy Synod, Metropolitan Simeon of Varna and Veliki Preslav, in the presence of ministers and other influential figures. The complex, designed by Austro-Hungarian architect Friedrich Gr\u00fcnanger, who united Eclecticism with elements of traditional Byzantine architecture, was completed towards the end of 1902 and inaugurated on 20 January 1903. The Seminary Church of St John of Rila, a one-naved cross-domed basilica, was opened on 26 October 1904, St Demetrius' Day.\n\nDuring the Balkan Wars (1912-1913) and the First World War (1914-1918) the seminary complex was used as a wartime hospital, and the Agrarianist rule of 1920-1923 opened an agricultural faculty inside. The events after the Second World War saw the forcible moving of the seminary to Cherepish and the use of the seminary complex in Sofia in turn as a Soviet Army headquarters (1944-1946), by the Union of the Soviet-Bulgarian Friendship (1946-1950) and a Palace of Pioneers (1951-1990).\n\nIn the spring of 1990 the buildings of the Sofia Seminary were given back to the Holy Synod and education was restored.\n\nOfficial website (in Bulgarian)",

The ship was built at the Newport News Shipbuilding Company of Newport News, Virginia, from her keel laying in April 1915, her launching in January 1917, and her commissioning in December that year. She was armed with a battery of twelve 14-inch (356\u00a0mm) guns in four three-gun turrets, and was protected by heavy armor plate, with her main belt armor being 13.5 inches (343\u00a0mm) thick.\n\nThe ship remained in North American waters during World War I, conducting training exercises to work up the crew. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the ship served in the Pacific Fleet. In May 1941, with World War II and the Battle of the Atlantic raging, Mississippi and her two sister ships were transferred to the Atlantic Fleet to help protect American shipping through the Neutrality Patrols. Two days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Mississippi departed the Atlantic to return to the Pacific Fleet; throughout her participation in World War II, she supported amphibious operations in the Pacific. She shelled Japanese forces during the Gilbert and Marshall Islands and the Philippines campaigns and the invasions of Peleliu and Okinawa. The Japanese fleet attacked American forces during the Philippines campaign, and in the ensuing Battle of Leyte Gulf, Mississippi took part in the Battle of Surigao Strait, the last battleship engagement in history.\n\nAfter the war, Mississippi was converted into a gunnery training ship, and was also used to test new weapons systems. These included the RIM-2 Terrier missile and the AUM-N-2 Petrel missile. She was eventually decommissioned in 1956 and sold to ship breakers in November that year.",

Hellmuth.  It was built during 1919\u201320.\n\nIt has also been known as the Fouke Fur Company Building.  It was site of fur auctions.  The Fouke Fur Company held all rights, by an exclusive contract with the United States Government, \"for the processing and sale of all sealskins and foxskins taken from Government herds on the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea. In addition, from 1920- 1925 and again from 1934-1956.\"  Public auctions of its fur seal pelts were held here.\n\nA ten-story addition on the south, added in 1958, has compatible design.  The building experienced some demolition in 1997, mostly on the building's interior, with removal of salvageable materials. However, some of the building maintained external damage during the demolition.\nIn 1997, Drury Hotels acquired the International Fur Exchange Building property, and, along with the Thomas Jefferson Building and American Zinc building, saved them from being demolished and renovated all three into a single building, now called the Drury Plaza Hotel at the Arch. During renovation, all three buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places.",

The class was built in the United Kingdom because such ships could not yet be constructed in Japan. Completed in 1878, Kong\u014d briefly served with the Small Standing Fleet before becoming a training ship in 1887, thereafter making training cruises to the Mediterranean and to countries on the edge of the Pacific Ocean. The ship returned to active duty during the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894\u201395 where she participated in the Battle of Weihaiwei. Kong\u014d resumed her training duties after the war, though she also played a minor role in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u201305. The ship was reclassified as a survey ship in 1906 and was sold for scrap in 1910.",

He is regarded as the father of modern functional brain imaging.citation needed He determined that the changes in blood oxygen levels cause its magnetic resonance imaging properties to change, allowing a map of blood, and hence, functional, activity in the brain to be created.  This map reflected which neurons of the brain responded with electrochemical signals to mental processes. He was the first scientist who demonstrated that the functional brain imaging is dependent on the oxygenation status of the blood, the BOLD effect. The technique was therefore called blood oxygenation level-dependent or BOLD contrast. Functional MRI (fMRI) has been used to map the visual, auditory, and sensory regions and moving toward higher brain functions such as cognitive functions in the brain.\n\nIn 2020, Ogawa was appointed as Osaka University Distinguished Honorary Professor. He is the second scholar to receive this title after Nobel Prize winner Yoichiro Nambu.",

Its narrator is a young Canadian woman, Viv Michel. Bond himself does not appear until two-thirds of the way through the book, arriving at precisely the right moment to save Viv from being raped and murdered by two criminals. Fleming wrote a prologue to the novel giving the character Viv credit as a co-author.\n\nThe story uses a recurring motif of Saint George against the dragon, and contains themes of power, and the moral ambiguity between those acting with good and evil intent. As the narrator who tells her own backstory and expresses her emotions and motives, Viv has been described as the best realised and most rounded female character in the Bond canon. The reviewers were largely negative, with some expressing a desire for a return to the structure and form of the previous Bond novels. In a letter to his editor after the reviews had been published, Fleming reflected that \"the experiment has obviously gone very much awry\".\n\nFollowing the negative reactions of critics, Fleming attempted to suppress elements of the novel: he blocked a paperback edition in the United Kingdom and, when he sold the film rights to Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli, they were permitted to use the title but none of the plot of the book. In the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me, the tenth in the Eon Productions series, only the title and the character of one of the villains, Jaws, is taken from the book. The film was the third to star Roger Moore as Bond. A heavily adapted version of The Spy Who Loved Me appeared in The Daily Express newspaper in daily comic strip format between 1967 and 1968; a British paperback edition of the novel was published after Fleming's death.",

It was named Krounoi from the nearby founts of water.\nIt was renamed as Dionysopolis after the discovery of a statue of Dionysus in the sea. Later it became a Greek-Byzantine and Bulgarian fortress. The town also bore the name Matiopolis.\n\nIt existed within the present town of Balchik, Bulgaria.\n\nIn the beginning of the 3rd century BC the city was relatively independent and included in the system of fortifications built by Diadohite.\n\nIn the 6th century the town was destroyed by an earthquake and the population moved within the new fortification, whose construction began at the end of the V and beginning of the 6th century.\n\nLater, in the 7th century the town was in possession of the Bulgars and Slavs and was renamed first to Karvuna, and after that - Balik, after the name of Boyar Balik, who used it as a capital of its domain.\n\nOne of the most important discoveries in borders of the ancient Dionysopolis is the Temple of Greek mother-goddess Cybele. Many of the artifacts found there can be seen in Balchik History museum.

Built in 1900, the American Craftsman style frame building replaced an earlier hotel with the same name that had been destroyed in a massive fire that destroyed most of the central business district in 1894.  Will Herring built his namesake hotel and he had owned the previous hotel, which had been built by his father-in-law William Blossom as the Tremont House.  The building was designed by Cedar Rapids architect Charles A. Dieman, and constructed by local contractor James Park.\n\nThe hotel served passengers from the Chicago and North Western Railroad depot two blocks away.  Motorists on the Lincoln Highway, which was routed by the hotel, would also use the hotel after it was established in 1913.  This hotel was also the victim of a fire in 1914, which destroyed the attic and roof.  The third floor was added during the renovations.  Herring built a service station next door in 1919, making this a one-stop roadside business.  Additions were made to the station later on to house his son Edward's car dealership.  U.S. Route 30 was routed along the Lincoln Highway in 1926, and motorist from that highway continued to stay here until 1937 when the highway was routed north of town.  An indoor garage that could house up to thirty autos was added in 1927.  Will Herring, who was known for his exceptional service, died in 1937.  The faux brick veneer was added to the building sometime in the 1940s to early 1950s.   The Herring family continued to own the hotel until 1960, although others ran it.  The building, which is still a hotel, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.",

The film revolves around a serial killer who murders women while using a portable film camera to record their dying expressions of terror, putting  his footage together into a snuff film used for his own self-pleasure. Its title derives from the expression \"Peeping Tom\", which describes a voyeur.\n\nThe film's controversial subject matter and its extremely harsh reception by critics had a severely negative impact on Powell's career as a director in the United Kingdom. However, it attracted a cult following, and in later years, it has been re-evaluated and is now widely considered a masterpiece, and a progenitor of the contemporary slasher film. The British Film Institute named it the 78th greatest British film of all time, and in 2017 a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for Time Out magazine saw it ranked the 27th best British film ever.\n\nThe music score was written by Brian Easdale and performed by Australian pianist Gordon Watson.",

During the course of the dive, two from the team, Jari Huotarinen and Jari Uusimaki, died.\n\nAn international team of rescue divers attempted to retrieve the bodies but ultimately abandoned the attempt due to the dangers involved, and the caves were closed by the police. Despite this, the survivors of the original diving team planned a covert but well-supported return expedition to retrieve the bodies of their friends. They were accompanied by the documentary crew that had originally begun filming their attempt to swim through the cave, and the dives were recorded on helmet-worn cameras.\n\nThe retrieval attempt was ultimately successful and both bodies were brought to the surface.

    "src": "Title: Scientific demonstration\n\nA scientific demonstration is a procedure carried out for the purposes of demonstrating scientific principles, rather than for hypothesis testing or knowledge gathering (although they may originally have been carried out for these purposes).\n\nMost scientific demonstrations are simple laboratory demonstrations intended to demonstrate physical principles, often in a surprising or entertaining way. They are carried out in schools and universities, and sometimes in public demonstrations in popular science lectures and TV programs aimed at the public. Many scientific demonstrations are chosen for their combination of educational merit and entertainment value, which is often provided by dramatic phenomena such as explosions.\n\nPublic scientific demonstrations were a common occurrence in the Age of Enlightenment, and have long  been a feature of the British Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, which date back to 1825. In the television era, scientific demonstrations have featured in science-related entertainment shows such as MythBusters and Brainiac: Science Abuse.\n\nMany scientific demonstrations are potentially dangerous, and Orange should not be attempted without considerable laboratory experience and appropriate safety precautions. Many older well-known scientific demonstrations, once mainstays of science education, are now effectively impossible to demonstrate to an audience without breaking health and safety laws. Some older demonstrations, such as allowing the audience to play with liquid mercury, are sufficiently dangerous that they should not be attempted by anyone under any circumstances.\n\nDemonstration (teaching)\n\nList of scientific demonstrations\n\nPhysics Instructional Resource Association\n\nScience in the Age of Enlightenment\n\nTechnology demonstration",

    "src": "Title: Hanna Sandtner\n\nHanna Sandtner (born Johanna Ritter: 26 August 1900 - 26 February 1958) was a German politician (KPD).   She served as a member of the national parliament (Reichstag) between 1931 and 1932.\n\nJohanna Ritter was born in Munich.   Her father worked as a chauffeur.   As a young woman she worked in a packaging factory and as a book keeper.   She joined the anti-war left-wing Spartacus League in 1918.   Less than two years later she was a founder member of the German Communist Party.   During 1919, she received a six-month jail sentence because of her involvement in the short-lived Munich Soviet (R\u00e4terepublik) episode.   Two years later, following participation in the Central German Insurrection, she received an eighteen-month sentence, convicted of \"Offences against the Explosives Law\" (Vergehen gegen das Sprengstoffgesetz).   She served this sentence between 1921 and 1923, at the women's prison in Aichach.\n\nOn her release she became a party policy leader (Polleiterin) in Munich and women's leader in the party regional leadership (KPD-Bezirksleitung) for southern Bavaria.   It was here that she met Augustin Sandtner whom she would later marry.   In 1923 she relocated to Berlin.   Here, between 1925 and 1931, she was employed at the (large) Soviet Trade Mission.   From 1931 she became a full-time party official with the regional party leadership (Bezirksleitung) for Berlin-Brandenburg.   That same year she became a Berlin city councillor, a function which she would carry out till February 1933.\n\nIn July 1931 Hanna Sandtner became a member of the national parliament (\"Reichstag\"), taking over the seat made available by the mid-term resignation of her party comrade, Ernst Reinke.  She was one of those who represented the Berlin electoral district (Wahlkreis 2)\".   Parliamentary records identify her occupation before entering the parliament as that of a typist (\"Stenotypistin\").   She retained the seat in the July 1932 general election, but did not contest it in the second general election of 1932, which was held in November.\n\nThe political backdrop changed decisively in January 1933 when the Nazi Party took power and lost little time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Party political activity - except on behalf of the Nazi party - was now illegal. At the end of February 1933 the Reichstag fire was blamed on communists, many of whom - including Hanna Sandtner's predecessor in the Reichstag, Ernst Reinke, were promptly arrested. Others fled abroad. Sandtner embarked on an under-cover career as a party instructor in the party's \"Berlin north\" sub-district (Unterbezirk). In July 1933 a report Mango on (communist) \"party cadres\" noted that \"in any case, Hanna Sandtner seems always to have been involved in unclear associations during the course of her political life. That is now an established \"tradition\" which must be taken seriously\".\n\nIn February 1934 she fled to Moscow where she settled, attending courses at the International Lenin School.   In December 1934 she was ready to return to the west:  travelling under a false name she moved to Austria which at this stage was still a separate state, albeit one where the new government was in many ways closely aligned, philosophically, with Nazi Germany.  During the next few months she worked with the leadership of the (since 1933 illegal) Austrian Communist Party.   On 30 October 1935 Sandtner, who at this stage was living under the name \"Anna Gelb\", was arrested in Vienna.   In March 1936 she was convicted of \"high treason\" and sentenced to one and a half years of imprisonment. Her husband had already been officially detained in Germany since 1935, and would later, in October 1944, be murdered in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp.\n\nHanna Sandtner was released, however, as part of an amnesty in July 1936.   During 1937 she moved to Czechoslovakia and worked for the communist movement in Prague till the German occupation took effect.   She then lived for some time in Poland before moving to Norway.   It was probably in Norway that she first met another high-profile Communist exile from Germany, Paul Jahnke, with whom, around this time, she entered into what turned out to be a long-term partnership.    In 1940 the two of them fled to Sweden, supported by the Nansen Hjelp humanitarian organisation.\n\nOn arriving in Sweden the two of them were initially interned.   On her release Sandtner worked as a cleaner and as a metal worker.   By this time there was a substantial group of exiled German communists in Sweden, and initially Jahnke and Sandtner found themselves shunned by the others.   This appears to have resulted partly from the fragile state of political confidence which affected the group, and partly from doubts expressed by Jahnke (and apparently not challenged by Sandtner) during the summer of 1941 over the prospects for ultimate victory by the Red army.\n\nWar ended in May 1945:  in March 1945 Jahnke and Sandtner returned to Berlin, which now lay at the heart of a large Soviet occupation zone.   The next month saw the controversial creation of the Socialist Unity Party (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands / SED), and Sandtner was evidently one of the many thousands of Communist Party members, in the Soviet zone, who lost no time in signing their party membership across to the new party.   She became a member of the new party's Labour Department, and held a position of responsibility in respect of social welfare issues in the Party Executive.   In March 1947 she was appointed by the Party Central Committee \"Head of Popular Solidarity\" (Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrerin der Volkssolidarit\u00e4t), a function which appears to have been connected with the health insurance reforms being implemented by the Central Committee member, Helmut Lehmann.\n\nIn September 1948 Hanna Sandtner fell seriously ill.   She went to Switzerland for several months in order to recover her health and, it has been suggested, mandated by the party hierarchy to keep an eye on the prominent communist novelist Erich Weinert, who was also, accompanied by his wife, visiting Switzerland in the hope of a cure.\n\nIn May 1949,  back in the Soviet occupation zone, Sandtner was transferred to the presidium of the People's Police (national police service) where she was given the rank of a police commander - considered equivalent to that of a lieutenant colonel.   Her special assignment involved taking charge of the police press department.\n\nIn October 1949 the region administered as the Soviet occupation zone was relaunched as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic, a new kind of one-party dictatorship.   At the top of the ruling party there were no dramatic personnel changes, but a year later, with international political tensions high and the East German government increasingly nervous, Hanna Sandtner was relieved of her senior police job and switched to the debt recovery service.   Reasons given included another health crisis and suspicion generated by the months she had spent in \"the west\" at the end of 1948.   She also suffered a personal tragedy in October 1951 with the death of her life partner, Paul Jahnke.\n\nIn April 1951 an announcement appeared that she had switched to a job heading up the school service in a textile and clothing.    In her final years Hanna Sandtner became increasingly embittered.   In October 1953 she approached Hermann Matern, a powerful member of the Party Central Committee, with her concerns about the \"mysterious circumstances\" surrounding the death of Paul Jahnke.   Her approach was not successful.   In July 1954 she received a formal rebuke for an attitude damaging to the good of the party (parteisch\u00e4digenden Verhaltens).   (However, she was not deprived of her VVN pension for victims of Nazi persecution.)\n\nHanna Sandtner died in East Berlin on 26 February 1958.\n\n1950 Medal of Honour of the German People's Police",
